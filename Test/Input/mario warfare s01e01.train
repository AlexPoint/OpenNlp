INVASION DAY
Lord Bowser|…
Our spies believe the King is still within the palace walls|.
As well as the princess|.
And what of her bodyguard|?
We have a score to settle|.
Leave him to me|.
Very well|.
Let the invasion begin|!
Command we have a red alert|-
Secure the roof|!
Overwatch in place|.
Rooftop secure|.
Grenade|!
Move out|.
Clear|.
Eastwing|: secure|.
Guard is down|.
They|'re somewhere here|.
Smoke 'em out|!
It|’s Bravo Team|…
Something doesn't feel right here|...
…|There should be more guys to shoot|.
What if it|'s a trap|?
Oh|, you think everything|'s a trap|.
Oh shit|, it|'s Toad|!
Take him out|-
Your Majesty|.
Princess|.
Let|'s go|.
Stay close|.
Stop right th|-
Wait wait wait|!
Don't shoot|!
Don’t shoot|!
Your majesty|…
We|'re completely surrounded|.
I don't see another option but surrender|.
Toad|, is there another escape route|?
There|'s a ventilation pipe at the end of the maintenance hall|.
But it|'s too small for a man to fit through|.
No|…|.
Princess|…
I need you to go with Toad now|.
No|, dad I|'m not gonna leave you|.
My beautiful daughter|…|.
Sometimes a princess has to do what is right for her kingdom|…|.
…|as does a king|.
This has been in our family for generations|.
As long as you wear it|…
I will be with you|…
...|keeping you safe|.
Then you keep it|…|.|you stay safe|.
I love you my daughter|.
Never forget that|.
I love you|.
Toad|.
You majesty|…
It|'s been my greatest honor|…|to serve with you|.
Princess|…|we need to go|.
Come on|…
Princess|, let|’s go|…
Run|!
Your orders sire|?
We know what Bowser does with prisoners|.
We won't be giving him any|.
We fight to the end|.
For the kingdom|.
For the kingdom|!
Still no sign of the target|.
Bowser|'s gonna be pissed|.
Bill|'s coming down|.
Wait here|.
Aw crap|, that|'s just what we need|.
Tell me where the girl is and I might let you live|.
OK|, you can go|-
Princess|, come on|.
I have an idea|.
Um|…|.
Toad|?
Alright|.
Off you go|, Princess|.
Toad|…
What|'s going to happen to you|?
Don't worry about me Princess|.
Just get to the end of the pipe and keep going|.
Don't let anyone know who you are
If I get out of here alive|, I|'ll find you|.
I promise|!
Now go|!
Bill|.
Toad|.
Now there won't be any question of who|'s the fastest gun in the mushroom kingdom|.
There never was|.
You never did know when to quit|, Toad|.
Not so fast|!
This|… …|is from the Princess|.
AGHHHHHHH|!!!!
