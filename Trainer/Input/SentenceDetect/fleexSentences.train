Easy, boy.
What do you expect?
They're savages.
One lot steals a goat from another lot, before you know it they're ripping each other to pieces.
I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.
I never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.
How close did you get?
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the wall.
Do the dead frighten you?
Our orders were to track the wildlings.
We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.
You don't think he'll ask us how they died?
Get back on your horse.
Whatever did it to them could do it to us.
They even killed the children.
It's a good thing we're not children.
You want to run away south, run away.
Of course they will behead you as a deserter, if I don't catch you first.
I won't say it again.
Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
They were here.
See where they went.
What is it?
It's...
Go on, father's watching.
And your mother.
Fine work as always.
Well done.
Thank you.
I love the detail that you've managed to get in these corners.
Quite beautiful.
The stitching...
And which one of you was a marksman at 10?
Keep practicing, Bran.
Go on.
Don't think too much, Bran.
Relax your bow arm.
Quick, Bran!
Faster.
Lord Stark!
My lady.
A guardsman just rode in from the hills.
They've captured a deserter from The Night's Watch.
Get the lads to saddle their horses.
Do you have to?
He swore an oath, Cat.
The law is law, my lady.
Tell Bran he's coming too.
Ned.
10 is too young to see such things.
He won't be a boy forever.
And winter is coming.
Lad, go run back and get the rest.
White Walkers.
I saw the White Walkers.
The White Walkers, I saw them.
I know I broke my oath.
And I know I'm a deserter.
I should have gone back to the wall and warned them, but--
I saw what I saw.
People need to know.
If you can get word to my family...
Tell them I'm no coward.
Tell them I'm sorry.
Forgive me, Lord.
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the first of his name...
- Don't look away.
King of the Andals and the first men...
Father will know if you do.
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and warden of the north, sentence you to die.
You did well.
You understand why I did it?
Jon said he was a deserter.
But do you understand why i had to kill him?
"Our way is the old way"?
The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
So he was lying?
A madman sees what he sees.
Mountain lion?
There are no Mountain lions in these woods.
It's a freak!
It's a direwolf.
Tough old beast.
There are no direwolves south of the wall.
Now there are five.
You want to hold it?
Where will they go?
Their mother's dead.
They don't belong down here.
Better a quick death.
They won't last without their mother.
- Right.
Give it here.
- No!
Put away your blade.
I take orders from your father, not you.
- Please, father!
- I'm sorry, Bran.
Lord Stark?
There are five pups...
one for each of the Stark children.
The direwolf is the sigil of your House.
They were meant to have them.
You will train them yourselves.
You will feed them yourselves.
And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.
What about you?
I'm not a Stark.
Get on.
The runt of the litter-- that one's yours, snow.
As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you: You worry too much.
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.
When we were seven and you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock, 100-foot drop into the water, and you were never afraid.
There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father.
"We're lannisters.
Lannisters don't act like fools."
What if Jon Arryn told someone?
But who would he tell?
- My husband.
- If he told the King, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now.
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him.
And Robert will choose a new Hand of the King-- someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores-- or is it the other way around?
And life will go on.
You should be The Hand of the King.
That's an honor I can do without.
Their days are too long, their lives are too short.
All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
You have five northern children.
You're not an outsider.
I wonder if the old gods agree.
It's your gods with all the rules.
I am so sorry, my love.
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.
Jon Arryn is dead.
A fever took him.
I know he was like a father to you.
- Your sister, the boy?
- They both have their health, gods be good.
The raven brought more news...
The King rides for Winterfell...
with the Queen and all the rest of them.
If he's coming this far north...
There's only one thing he's after.
You can always say no, Ned.
We'll need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber.
I'm told he reads all night.
I'm told he drinks all night.
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...
Stature?
We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar.
- Perhaps we'll find out.
- In any case, candles.
Why is your mother so dead set on us getting pretty for the King?
It's for the Queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.
I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.
He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.
Gods, but they grow fast.
Brandon!
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.
How many times have I told you no climbing?
But he's coming right now-- down our road.
I want you to promise me, no more climbing.
I promise.
- Do you know what?
- What?
You always look at your feet before you lie.
Run and find your father.
Tell him the King is close.
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?
- Hey hey hey hey.
- Ohh.
What are you doing with that on?
Move!
Your Grace.
You've got fat.
- Cat!
- Your Grace.
Nine years-- why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?
Guarding the north for you, your Grace.
Winterfell is yours.
- Where's the imp?
- Will you shut up?
Who have we here?
You must be Robb.
My, you're a pretty one.
Your name is?
Arya.
Oh, show us your muscles.
You'll be a soldier.
That's Jaime Lannister, the Queen's twin brother.
Would you please shut up?
My Queen.
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.
We've been riding for a month, my love.
Surely the dead can wait.
Where's the imp?
Where is our brother?
Go and find the little beast.
Tell me about Jon Arryn.
One minute he was fine and then...
Burned right through him, whatever it was.
I loved that man.
We both did.
He never had to teach you much, but me?
You remember me at 16?
All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls.
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.
I need you, Ned-- down at King's Landing, not up here where you're no damn use to anybody.
Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.
I'm not worthy of the honor.
I'm not trying to honor you.
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink and whore my way to an early grave.
Damn it, Ned, stand up.
You helped me win the iron throne, now help me keep the damn thing.
We were meant to rule together.
If your sister had lived, we'd have been bound by blood.
Well, it's not too late.
I have a son, you have a daughter.
We'll join our Houses.
- It is true what they say about the northern girls.
Did you hear the King's in Winterfell?
I did hear something about that.
And the Queen and her twin brother.
They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
And the other brother?
- The Queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one, and there's the clever one.
Mmm, I hear they call him the imp.
I hear he hates that nickname.
Oh?
I hear he's more than earned it.
I hear he's a drunken little lecher, prone to all manner of perversions.
Clever girl.
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.
Have you?
- Oh!
- Already?
The gods gave me one blessing.
- Don't get up.
- My Lord.
Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door?
- in a whorehouse, brother?
- You have much to teach me, no doubt, but our sister craves your attention.
She has odd cravings, our sister.
A family trait.
Now the Starks are feasting us at sundown.
Don't leave me alone with these people.
I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.
And this is the first of many courses.
I thought you might say that.
But since we're short on time...
Come on, girls.
See you at sundown.
Close the door!
Did you have to bury her in a place like this?
She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
She was my sister.
This is where she belongs.
She belonged with me.
In my dreams, I kill him every night.
It's done, your Grace.
The Targaryens are gone.
Not all of them.
Daenerys!
Daenerys.
There's our bride-to-be.
Look, a gift from Illyrio.
Touch it.
Go on, feel the fabric.
Mmm.
Isn't he a gracious host?
We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
Illyrio's no fool.
He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne.
You still slouch.
Let them see.
You have a woman's body now.
I need you to be perfect today.
Can you do that for me?
You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?
No.
When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.
It's too hot, my lady.
Where is he?
The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven.
May I present my honored guests?
Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name, the rightful king of the Andals and the first men, and his sister Daenerys of House Targaryen.
Do you see how long his hair is?
When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids so the whole world can see their shame.
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.
He's a savage, of course, but one of the finest killers alive.
And you will be his Queen.
Come forward, my dear.
Where is he going?!
- The ceremony is over.
- But he didn't say anything.
- Did he like her?
- Trust me, your Grace, if he didn't like her, we'd know.
It won't be long now.
Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne.
The people drink secret toasts to your health.
They cry out for their true king.
When will they be married?
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.
Is it true they lie with their horses?
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
Do you take me for a fool?
I take you for a King.
Kings lack the caution of common men.
My apologies if I've given offense.
I know how to play a man like Drogo.
I give him a Queen and he gives me an army.
I don't want to be his Queen.
I want to go home.
So do I.
I want us both to go home, but they took it from us.
So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?
I don't know.
We go home with an army.
With Khal Drogo's army.
I would let his whole tribe fuck you-- all 40,000 men and their horses too if that's what it took.
Do you think Joffrey will like me?
What if he thinks I'm ugly?
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
He's so handsome.
When would we be married?
Soon?
Or do we have to wait?
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.
Why would he say no?
He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
He'd have to leave home.
He'd have to leave me.
And so would you.
You left your home to come here.
And I'd be Queen someday.
Please make father say yes!
- Sansa--
- Please please!
It's the only thing I ever wanted.
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.
Come on!
Is he dead yet?
Uncle Benjen.
You got bigger.
Rode all day.
Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters.
Why aren't you at the feast?
Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
Well, you're always welcome on the wall.
No bastard was ever refused a seat there.
So take me with you when you go back.
- Jon--
- Father will let me if you ask him.
I know he will.
The wall isn't going anywhere.
I'm ready to swear your oath.
You don't understand what you'd be giving up.
We have no families.
- None of us will ever father sons--
- I don't care about that!
You might, if you knew what it meant.
I'd better get inside, rescue your father from his guests.
We'll talk later.
Your Uncle's in The Night's Watch.
What are you doing back there?
Preparing for a night with your family.
I've always wanted to see the wall.
You're Tyrion Lannister, the Queen's brother?
My greatest accomplishment.
And you-- you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?
Did I offend you?
Sorry.
You are the bastard though.
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
And Lady Stark is not your mother, making you the bastard.
Let me give you some advice, bastard.
Never forget what you are.
The rest of the world will not.
Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.
What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.
You at a feast-- it's like a bear in a trap.
The boy I beheaded-- did you know him?
- Of course I did.
Just a lad.
And he was tough, Ned, a true ranger.
Pfft.
He was talking madness.
Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
The two he was with are still missing.
Hmph.
A wildling ambush.
Maybe.
Direwolves south of the wall, talk of The Walkers, and my brother might be the next Hand of the King.
Winter is coming.
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
Is this your first time in the north, your Grace?
Yes.
Lovely country.
I'm sure it's very grim after King's Landing.
I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.
Hello, little dove.
But you are a beauty.
- How old are you?
- 13, your Grace.
You're tall.
Still growing?
I think so, your Grace.
And have you bled yet?
No, your Grace.
Your dress, did you make it?
Such a talent.
You must make something for me.
I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
I hear the same.
Your daughter will do well in the capital.
Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.
- I hope it's true.
- Yes, the King has honored me with his offer.
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate your new title-- if you accept.
It would be good to have you on the field.
The competition has become a bit stale.
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?
Getting a little old for it?
I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real I don't want him to know what I can do.
Well said.
Arya!
It's not funny!
She always does this.
This was my favorite dress.
She always does it and it's not funny!
Time for bed.
I'm a Northman.
I belong here with you, not down south in that rats' nest they call a capital.
I won't let him take you.
The king takes what he wants.
That's why he's King.
I'll say, "listen, fat man."
"You are not taking my husband anywhere.
He belongs to me now."
How did he get so fat?
He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
It's Maester Luwin, my Lord.
Send him in.
Pardon, my Lord, my Lady.
A rider in the night...
from your sister.
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.
What's she doing at the Eyrie?
She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
What news?
She's fled the capital.
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.
By the Lannisters.
She says the King is in danger.
She's fresh widowed, Cat.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter.
Do you think she would risk her life-- her son's life-- if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?
If this news is true and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the King?
They murdered the last Hand.
Now you want Ned to take the job?
The King rode for a month to ask for Lord Stark's help.
He's the only one he trusts.
You swore the King an oath, my Lord.
He's spent half his life fighting Robert's wars.
He owes him nothing.
Your father and brother rode south once on a King's demand.
A different time.
A different King.
When do I meet with the Khal?
We need to begin planning the invasion.
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.
- When?
When their omens favor war.
I piss on Dothraki omens.
I've waited 17 years to get my throne back.
A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
Jadi, zhey jorah andahli!
Khal vezhven.
A small gift, for the new Khaleesi-- songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
Thank you, Ser.
Are you from my country?
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
I served your father for many years.
Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful King.
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.
The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.
Thank you, Magister.
She's beautiful.
Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say thank you in Dothraki.
There is no word for thank you in Dothraki.
Make him happy.
Do you know the common tongue?
Is "no" the only word that you know?
No.
Rough night, imp?
If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other it'll be a miracle.
I didn't pick you for a hunter.
The greatest in the land-- my spear never misses.
It's not hunting if you pay for it.
Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
No, but I'm still better than you.
I know what I'm putting you through.
Thank you for saying yes.
I only ask you because I need you.
You're a loyal friend.
You hear me?
A loyal friend.
The last one I've got.
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.
And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time.
Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!
Come on, you.
Stop!
Stop.
Are you completely mad?
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.
- It's all right.
- He saw us!
I heard you the first time.
Quite the little climber, aren't you?
- How old are you, boy?
- 10.
10.
The things I do for love.
- Easy, boy.
Man: What do you expect?
They're savages.
- How close did you get?
Bran: Where will they go?
- Put away your blade.
- The direwolf is the sigil of your House.
Catelyn: We'll need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber.
- Gods, but they grow fast.
- Go on.
Robert: Who have we here?
Arya: That's Jaime Lannister, the Queen's twin brother.
Sansa: Would you please shut up?
Robert: He never had to teach you much, but me?
- All I wanted to do - It is true what they say about the northern girls.
Tyrion: Close the door!
Man: Daenerys!
Tyrion: Your Uncle's in The Night's Watch.
- Arya!
Robb: Time for bed.
Ned: I'm a Northman.
Man: It's Maester Luwin, my Lord.
Illyrio: Dragon's eggs, Daenerys, No.
- No.
- Stop.
Episode 2: Bunk Off The local park, where people come to play football, hang out with their friends, and most importantly, let their dogs shit.
It's not a cool place, admittedly, but it is a good place to stare at girls.
If anything's worth braving this dogshit minefield for, it's staring at girls.
You lot are gay.
Why aren't we playing football?
Chasing men around a field with your top off, what's more gay than that?
- You.
Brilliant.
Anyway, we're playing Frisbee because girls can join in.
Trust me, girls love this.
- Border collies love this.
You're too scared in case Donovan joins in and breaks your legs.
- That's not true.
- Oh, my God...
Check out the Jugasaurus Rex!
- Shit!
And it's Carli.
- Perfect.
Watch this.
Carli!
Catch!
Oh, fuck.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry!
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.
So as I say, I'm sorry.
It's fine.
You've apologised 30 times.
Come on.
I'm going to get my Frisbee.
Those wankers are nicking that girl's Frisbee.
It's my Frisbee!
I've got a receipt!
So, in what I can only describe as an attack of Frisbee rage, once again we were running from Donovan.
All right?
- Not really.
- What's up?
Think, Neil.
Last time you saw us, before you legged it, a Frisbee was heading to a disabled girl's face.
- Did it hit her in the face then?
- Bingo!
Was the girl in the wheelchair all right?
I've lost my Frisbee Aero B Pro.
- Is the gayest sentence ever.
- That's it.
- We can't bunk off tomorrow now.
- Why?
It's bad karma, innit?
For hitting a spastic.
- It could be a sign.
- That you've shit your pants?
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- To wank over your mum's bras?
- As she's my mum?
Probably not!
- Oh, good, can I have them then?
But you can have...
that.
And that.
See you tomorrow.
See you.
I'd only been in state education a month and yet, I found myself ready to break the law.
Okay, it was the truancy law, but it was still the worst thing I'd ever done.
Hello, William.
Hello, Mrs Cooper.
Is Simon in?
Unless he ran away in the middle of the night...
- Simon!
- Yes, all right.
Will, come in.
Why aren't you in uniform?
We're sorry, Mrs Cooper, it was Jay's idea...
We forgot to tell you it was a non-uniform day.
- No, it's not.
Bye.
- Yes, it is.
For Years 12 and 13.
It is, you little shit!
Right, so it's a Year 12 non-uniform day?
For Christ's sake, Simon, you're 17 now and I don't want to play these stupid games.
It's a bloody non-uniform day, allright?
I don't believe you.
Will?
Yes, it's a non-uniform day.
- See?
- Fine.
Fine.
But if you've lied to me I won't be angry, I will be really, really disappointed.
How stupid is she that she totally believed us?
- That's my mum.
- Sorry, did you see the way I just lied to her?
I totally did it.
We're bunking off.
- Who are you calling?
- School.
I'll just say we're ill and won't be in today.
No, really.
Who are you calling?
Don't shit your pants.
I'm only phoning the school secretary, not fucking MI5.
Hello, this is Mrs Cooper, Simon's mother.
Simon and Will MacKenzie have food poisoning.
- Must have been after the chicken.
- You're putting on your mum's voice?
I'm sorry.
Mrs Cooper, you say your son is ill?
Well, Mr Gilbert, the Head of Sixth is just here.
- I'll pass him over.
- No, there's really no need.
We can still make it for English!
Hello?
This is Mrs Cooper, Simon and his friend Will are ill, goodbye.
- Mrs Cooper?
- Yes?
- What exactly is wrong with Simon?
- Food poisoning.
OK, Simon, that's enough, I know you're bullshitting me.
- I think you'd better get to school.
- Cheers.
All the best.
Get in before you make me...
Well, that was fucking dreadful.
- I think he bought it though.
- In what way did he buy it?
I think he thought that was my mum.
So with our terrible alibi in place, phase two of the plan was how to get some booze.
You look like you're on day release.
They'll never serve you.
- What about this one?
- No, not one of this suits.
- He'll go mental if he finds out.
- Shirts.
- Not the suit.
- Yes!
Not the suit.
And so in Simon's dad's suit, and looking a bit like a Hasidic Jew, we headed for the off-licence.
- What are you wearing?
- The suit's my dad's.
He insisted.
- The hat's his though.
- What a bell end!
I'm just an adult man stocking up on booze.
This'll work.
£10 each, please.
And as none of you offered to do it, you can fuck off.
- Nothing.
Unlike those morons, I knew the key to getting served was confidence.
- Good day.
- Sorry?
Good day.
Hello.
- Oh, shit.
Nothing.
- It's Carli's mum, innit?
- Jay, don't.
She'll recognise me.
He wants to suck your Carli's tits!
Unbelievable.
The key is to let the shop owner know who's in control.
It like a Jedi mind trick.
I am an adult.
You will serve me.
Can I help at all?
Yes, I am a man who has recently bought a house in the local area and I'm having a house-warming party to which I'll be inviting a lot of the local adults.
- Hence the crisps.
- Yeah.
I'll also probably need some...
alcohol as well.
- As well as the crisps, et cetera...
- What are you looking for?
Some Beefeater gin.
- How about two bottles?
- Excellent.
- Some wine?
- Christ!
We're not made of money!
And I'll have some extra-strong mints.
- For those who are drink-driving.
- Right...
- That comes to £29.50.
Anything else?
- What's on special?
A bottle of Drambuie for a tenner if you are out of the shop in five seconds.
Done.
My good man.
I shall invite you to the party.
- Mission accomplished.
- What's in all the bags then?
Something to soak up the alcohol.
- Crisps?
- Where's the beer?
Have you spent all our money on fucking crisps?
- You twat.
- What the fuck's this?
- Drambuie.
- What's Drambuie?
- Whisky-based liqueur.
- What's a liqueur?
- A bender's drink.
- Why have we got that?
- It's your dad's favourite drink.
- My dad's not bent.
- He is a bit though.
- He's fucking not.
The evidence: one, your mum left him because he loves cock.
No, she was in a difficult place!
- In bed with a bender.
- Your dad, who is a bender.
Two, he wears tight denim shorts to do the gardening.
The only night he goes out all week is Wednesday and that's to play badminton!
My dad's not bent because he's got porn mags at home - and it's all straight.
- All straight?
Some lesbian.
- We should go and have a look.
- Fine, come on then.
- This should be good.
- I bet it's 90% cock.
They must be around here somewhere.
I don't know where they could have gone.
Maybe he swapped them for an Abba boxset.
He probably shoved them up his arse.
Drink!
- What we gonna do today then?
- Anything we fucking well please.
- Specifically, what?
- We could get some birds.
Let's get some girls.
Great.
- Where are all the girls?
- At school.
We'll wait for them to get out.
We're not doing anything until half three?
We could have gone to school.
We can't fucking do this.
Hello, Mrs Cooper?
Sorry to bother you at work.
This is Mr Gilbert, Simon's Head of Sixth.
Your mum is so fit, Will, I reckon she could be a prostitute.
- Thanks...
Have you wanked over Will's mum.
Not yet.
Please don't have a wank over my mum.
I can't promise that, I'm afraid.
Yes, hello.
Is that Mrs MacKenzie, William's mother?
Right.
Can I just check something with you?
When we're with the Caravan Club there's this bird and her sister who I've shagged for two years.
Sometimes I get them to strum themselves while I watch.
Sorry, did you say you go on holiday in a caravan?
- With the Caravan Club.
- In a caravan like a gypo?
If my mum told me we were going caravanning I'd call Childline.
It's a sense of freedom you don't get with other holidays.
It's a sense of shitting in a bucket in a cupboard you don't get with other holidays, in England, with your parents.
Actually, it's a well-known fact that the Caravan Club is like a sex club all over Europe, which is why I've lost my cherry and none of you sad acts have.
- I could have got laid loads!
- No, you couldn't.
Yeah, I could.
But I want to lose it with someone I love.
What?
Like Carli?
Maybe I do love Carli.
She's gorgeous, she's smart, she's amazing.
Worth mentioning to her then, mate, if that's the way you feel.
- Yeah, why not mention it?
Worse that can happen you get nothing.
Best that can happen, you get stinky fingers.
You really are one of the most disgusting humans I've ever met.
Look out.
Prince Harry's had a few drinks and now he thinks he's hard!
- I am hard.
- Scared of teachers and brown-nosing everyone's parents is just an act?
- I don't brown-nose anyone!
- You do a bit.
- Good manners cost nothing.
- A good shag costs nothing!
A good shag with Carli.
# Carli's fanny on your face, on your face # # Carli's fanny on your face!
I keep catching myself on it.
It's a bloody menace.
Hang on, I think someone's in.
# And your bell end # # Carli's fanny on your face, on your face...
Neil!
What the hell is going on?
This place smells like a brewery and not a nice one.
Jay, there is always trouble when you're around, but Will, I'm especially surprised at you...
So sorry, Steve.
Oh, piss off!
Don't talk to me like that in my own house!
Oh, I'm so sorry, my manners.
Piss off, please.
- I've had enough of your lip.
- You'd like my lip, wouldn't you?
Right round your bell end, if Mr Chippy doesn't get there first.
What's he knocking up?
A closet for you to hide in, you bumder?
In hindsight, I might have taken it a bit too far.
Amazing!
Jesus Christ.
"Bumder"?!
Fair play to you, that was pretty special.
"Bumder"!
It's a mixture of "bummer" and "bender".
He'll be all right about it, though.
He can take a joke.
- That was taken as a joke.
- "My lips around your bell end"?
- Yeah, it should be fine!
- I love Carli.
I love Carli.
Shit, I've got to tell her.
What if she feels the same?
- Seems fairly unlikely.
- Life is about these moments.
It's the things you don't do you regret.
It's the {kind of }cavalier philosophy that caused my father to leave my mother.
- You go for it.
- Bumder.
And so we headed for Carli's house.
I feel a bit stupid doing this.
This is fine, isn't it?
Yeah.
Definitely.
You would tell me if I was being a dick?
- Of course I would.
- Yeah, yeah.
Writing her surname is particularly important.
It's her drive, but you wouldn't want Carli-based confusion.
If you put a kiss, she'll suck you off.
- What the fuck is that?
Simon, why are you vandalising my drive?
What does it say?
You love me?
Look.
I can easily wash it off and we can just pretend it never happened and I could not tell anyone and you could not tell anyone and my mates could not tell anyone and your mates could not tell anyone.
Simon, we've known each other for ages.
Why now?
We were playing dares.
Did someone dare you to be the world's biggest saddo?
So what?
You are in love with me?
This couldn't have gone any better.
Actually I think this is pretty cool, Simon.
Sort of artistic.
It's like Banksy or someone.
Why don't you come over to mine tonight, I'm baby-sitting my brother, and we can sort this out?
- Really?
Yeah, come round about eight.
My folks will be out by then.
Best to avoid them until this has washed away.
- I'm not sure this washes away...
- Whatever.
See you later.
Yes!
Incredibly, I think you might be in there.
Of course he is.
She's wet for you, mate.
I can't believe it worked.
Maybe, she was impressed by your artistic side.
- No, it's because you're drunk.
- Do you think so?
Yes, it's because you're wasted.
Like Pete Doherty?
Girls love it.
- I think Pete Doherty is on heroin.
- I'm not sure I should do heroin!
Right, vodka, whisky, and a load of creme de menthe.
When she sees you, she'll be frothing at the gash.
- Are you sure my dad won't notice?
- No, he'll never tell.
He might as his whisky now tastes of apple juice.
It'll be worth it.
- What's that?
- Fuck off!
- What have you got there?
- And again, fuck off!
- You are in such shit.
- That's a hat-trick.
Fuck off!
Mum knows you bunked off.
And also everyone knows that you love Carli D'Amato.
- I don't love her, actually.
- Everyone knows, you spaz.
You wrote it on the pavement outside her house.
Even the Year 11s were laughing about how sad you are.
Yeah?
How sad is a date at her house tonight?
You're such a sad...
No, you're the sad because...
Twat!
- You're such a little fuckshit.
- He's made you look a right nob.
- When are you going to make the move?
- I don't know.
- I've got to get the kid out the way.
- I could come and look after him.
I'll take care of the kid while you take care of the...
business.
Business.
- I think I'd better take Will.
Your funeral.
Jay was wrong.
It wouldn't be a funeral, but it would be as much fun as one.
So that evening, we arrived at the house of the girl Simon had always loved and we were drunk, so very drunk.
- Hi.
- Hello, there.
- Hello, William.
You coming in then, Simon?
Are you his chaperone?
No, babes.
He's gonna watch the kid while we chat about, you know, our feelings.
- Best not to call me babes though.
Really.
Come on in then.
Chris is watching TV, Will.
Come on, you, let's get a drink.
So Dad went totally ballistic about the driveway.
I think you're still invited over for Christmas but he's gonna make your parents pay for an industrial stone cleaner.
- It was worth it.
- Can you smell bleach?
- What are you watching?
- Don't know.
- I think there's been a big bomb.
Oh, it's one of those recreations of a dirty bomb.
What's a dirty bomb?
It's just a big nuclear bomb that terrorists would use to kill everyone in London.
Have you been drinking spirits?
Sorry, don't know what I was thinking.
Would you like some?
- I'll stick to wine, thanks.
- Wine is for girls.
- I am a girl.
- This is a man's drink.
If you don't want it, I'll have it.
And if you can't take me like this, well I'm sorry, babes, but this is the package.
There goes the tallest building in London.
That'll be a few thousand dead.
My mum and dad are in London tonight.
Would they be killed?
Not only killed but obliterated.
Merely a scorched shadow on the pavement.
Dust.
- So they are dead forever?
- Yes, dead forever.
My mummy!
My daddy!
Come on, Carli.
You know why I'm here.
And I know why I'm here.
And you know why I'm here.
- Kiss me.
- You know I've got a boyfriend.
- Just finger yourself in front of me.
- Jesus, Simon!
They do it in Caravan Club.
Come on, I know you want to.
- Well I don't want to, so...
- Yeah, you do.
Simon, are you all right?
Oh, Christ.
I don't think I'm very well.
- Daddy!
Mummy!
- Chris?
I was just telling him about terrorists and stuff.
You were telling a seven-year-old about terrorists?
He won't sleep for a week now, you idiot.
Have you unblocked the sink yet?
All the lumps?
I am really sorry.
I think maybe I ate something.
Could we maybe sit down and talk about us?
Have you got any Nurofen?
It's just...
Oh dear.
I think we'll be off now.
Right, I think we'd better get you back to mine and cleaned up.
Oh, God, my head.
I've ruined it.
I love her and I've ruined it with her.
Oh, God.
She's so amazing.
I'm going to say this to you as a friend.
Shut up.
Today's been a fuck-up from start to finish.
We need to write it off, OK?
Today's gone.
It isn't going to get any worse.
Oh, shit.
Isn't that your mum's car?
And that's Neil's dad's car.
Well, it's every Wednesday and we play sort of, I suppose, best-of-three games.
The changing facilities are not too bad.
- All in all, it's a good thing.
Sit down, you two.
Sometimes in life you have to sit down, take your punishment like a man.
Unfortunately, this was not one of those times.
You've had quite a day off.
You've lied to your mothers, bought alcohol illegally, abused Neil's dad, stole my suit, defaced the pavement outside Carli's.
Am I missing anything?
We also hit a spastic with a Frisbee.
- I feel totally let down, William.
- It wasn't our fault, Mum.
I said to Kevin here, I thought I brought you up better than that.
- It isn't our fault.
- Why's it not your fault then?
It all happened because he touched us.
- Me?
He touched us here, and here.
And here.
- The bumhole.
- You evil little shits!
I'll deal with this, Kevin.
Now listen to me, you two.
That is an extraordinary allegation.
You should think {very }carefully before you repeat it.
- Just cos Kevin's gay doesn't mean...
- No, I'm not gay.
- We're all friends, it doesn't matter.
- I'm not gay.
I was married for{ nearly}...
- Oscar Wilde was married.
- That is enough!
- Although, he is right, Kevin...
- I'm not gay!
All right, don't have a hissy fit.
Just because Kevin is gay doesn't make him automatically a paedophile.
I'm not a paedophile.
If you want to repeat those allegations, we'll take them seriously.
But if you want to tell us the truth, that it never happened we'll move on to the other things - you're in trouble for.
- OK.
The truth is...
we're alcoholics.
You have to help us.
All we can think about is where the next drink is gonna come from.
We're literally out of control.
Today we even talked about heroin.
There's a long road ahead of us but with your support and your love we think we can make it.
So please, as our parents, help us.
And so we were so pathetic, even my mum, who has no sense of humour, was laughing at us.
- Hello.
You look well.
- Thanks.
How's your mum?
Not happy.
But fit like a prostitute.
How's your dad?
Really not happy.
But at least he's not bent like Neil's.
Shit, Si, you don't look well, mate.
What happened?
He was up all night fucking Carli's brains out.
Not quite.
Obvioulsy, by "Not quite", he means he puked on her brother's head then accused Neil's dad of being a paedophile.
You dickhead.
What a knob!
- My dad's not a paedo.
- Now, boys.
Good of you to join us today.
- Shit indeed.
Now, boys, you are in the sixth form.
So actually you're under no legal obligation to attend school.
Sutherland, Cartwright, if you want to piss away your chance of gaining some qualifications and improving your lives, then be my guest.
I still get paid at the end of the week.
Oh, great.
- Brilliant.
Thanks, sir.
I knew no day could go as badly as yesterday did.
However, Cooper, MacKenzie, phoning the school and pretending to be your parents?
That, my little friends, is fraud.
I think we'd better go and see the head.
They say it's the things you don't do in life that you regret.
Well that's clearly not true.
I regret hitting that girl with a Frisbee.
And I regret hurling insults at Neil's dad.
Bumder!
And I'm pretty certain Simon regrets almost everything he did that day.
Oh, dear.
But they also say all's well that ends well.
Hang on, this didn't even end well.
Transcript: Evarin - Synchro: Tagne You think I can't hear you every day talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and black magic?
I don't want you talking to him till we get to Castle Black.
We're not going to Castle Black.
Jon Snow isn't there.
Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
Oh, no, I'm not going back there.
I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.
You won't win.
You don't have the discipline.
- You don't know how to fight together.
- You don't know that.
If you attack the Wall you'll die, all of you.
All of us.
I can't force them to meet us in the field.
- Casterly Rock can't run away.
- Can you do it?
There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army.
Walder Frey.
We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters.
- You were sent here to kill me?
- I don't want to.
What do your captains have to say about that?
You should ask them.
Will you fight for me?
The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis.
My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours.
- Is that the Blackwater?
- Where do you think I'm taking you?
- Back to King's Landing.
- That's the Red Fork.
I'm taking you to the Twins.
Your uncle's marrying one of the Frey girls.
Your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
That rain will cost us another day.
Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
- He's getting the wedding he wanted.
- He's getting a wedding.
It was a king he wanted.
It's come for the baby.
You stay back!
No, you can't have him.
No!
Are you sure about this?
It's dangerous.
If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible.
Take his home, take his gold, take his power.
Why are you telling me?
You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
Now Winterfell is burnt to the ground, the North is overrun with ironborn, and Bran and Rickon are gone.
So Casterly Rock...
I'm asking your advice.
We have enough men?
If Walder Frey cooperates.
If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing before we take the castle...
we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.
We'll lose the war and die the way Father died.
Or worse.
Show them how it feels to lose what they love.
My honored guests...
be welcome within my walls and at my table.
I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven.
We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.
I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness.
Don't beg my forgiveness, Your Grace.
It wasn't me you spurned.
It was my girls.
One of them was supposed to be queen.
Now none of them are.
This is Arwyen my daughter.
My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra.
My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.
Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins.
You could have had either.
Could have had both for all I care.
My granddaughter Marianne.
My granddaughter Freya.
My granddaughter...
Wertha.
Waldra.
Waldina.
- I'm Merry.
And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet.
Clearly you don't have the patience for all that.
My ladies.
All men should keep their word, kings most of all.
I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.
The fault is not with you.
Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.
I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another.
I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house.
I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends.
Very good.
There she is.
Come closer.
Let me have a look at you.
Still can't see you.
Old eyes.
Love.
That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?
Very honorable.
I call it a pretty face.
Mmm, very pretty.
Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.
Very shapely as well.
Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.
If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place.
I can always see what's going on beneath a dress.
Been at this a long time.
I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is.
Doesn't drop an inch.
Your king says he betrayed me for love.
I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
And I can respect that.
When I was your age, I'd have broken 50 oaths to get into that without a second thought.
Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.
We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men.
Thank you, my lord.
Well, let's get ready.
The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us.
Where?
There.
It's a back gate.
My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.
Your men, but not you?
I have no interest in slaves.
A man cannot make love to property.
This is where we enter the city.
Very few guards.
They know me.
They let me inside--
We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
I kill the guards.
I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates.
Then comes the army.
Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.
Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army.
The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways 'cause you've already slaughtered your partners.
You have a very suspicious mind.
In my experience, only dishonest people think this way.
You command the Unsullied.
What do you think?
You leave tonight.
Very good.
We'll prepare.
Ser Jorah.
You can use an extra sword.
You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan.
Your place is by the queen.
If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost, no matter our pride.
We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us.
It was the first castle on the Wall.
The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.
Too big.
Impossible to maintain.
Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.
It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.
No one's used it in centuries most likely.
It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens, I do.
How do you know all that?
I read about it in a very old book.
You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
You're like a wizard.
Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived.
Here we are.
Alive.
Remember what happens to children who run.
I'm your father and I'll do the talking.
The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they?
Cracked three spokes this morning.
- Need a hand?
- Need about eight hands.
Oh!
Got to get this salt pork to the Twins in time for the wedding.
Many thanks.
Don't!
Don't kill him.
Dead rats don't squeak.
You're so dangerous, aren't you?
Saying scary things to little girls.
Killing little boys and old people.
A real hard man you are.
More than anyone you know.
You're wrong.
I know a killer.
- A real killer.
- That so?
You'd be like a kitten to him.
He'd kill you with his little finger.
That him?
- Good.
Please.
Please don't.
You're very kind.
Someday it'll get you killed.
Where are we?
The Gift, I think.
Brandon the Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night's Watch for their sustenance and support.
Maester Luwin taught me that.
Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
It's good land and there's no war up here.
Why leave?
Wildlings.
But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women.
Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
That's what Old Nan said.
There's a storm coming.
I don't see any--
It's as good a place to shelter as any.
We can drink some blood while we wait.
I don't need much.
Only one old man and eight good horses.
What's one old man doing with eight horses?
He breeds them for the Watch.
How's he keep folks from stealing them?
The Watch protects him.
Not today they don't.
He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there.
- And proper steel.
- Let's carve him up.
We just take the horses and go.
The old man's no threat.
I keep telling you.
He's an old man.
A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.
They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
I hope so.
Killing crows in their castle is tough.
Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do.
Spread out.
Surround the hut and move in.
Ygritte!
Clear the barn!
No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.
Best part of the animal.
Don't worry.
They're still there.
I know they're still there.
You check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move.
I'm not afraid.
Of course you are.
You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it.
The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.
No point in trying to hide behind that face.
I know fear when I see it.
Seen it a lot.
I knew fear when I saw it in you.
You're afraid of fire.
When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl.
And I know why, too.
I heard what your brother did to you.
Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop.
That give you some ideas?
Might do.
Go ahead, then.
You might get away.
Might even make it there on your own.
They're just over the river.
The closest you've been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.
Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
How are we going to get past the Wall?
My uncle said it's 700 feet high.
How did you get past it?
Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
Some climb straight up the ice.
Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.
Hodor.
19 castles guard the Wall.
- Only three are still manned.
- Hodor!
One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.
Well, we'll have to open them up again.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- There's a rider out there.
Just one?
- There's more.
- Hodor!
Shh.
- It's just thunder, sweet giant.
- Hodor.
I yield.
- I yield.
- Wildlings.
Where's Shaggydog and Summer?
Hunting.
Hodor!
- Shh, quiet, Hodor.
Make him shut up.
If they hear us...
- Hush, Hodor.
No-- no more Hodoring.
- Hodor, calm down.
- You need to keep quiet.
- They're gonna hear us.
Hodor, be quiet.
- Ah!
- Hodor, be quiet!
What did you do?
What's that?
That's a horse dying.
Bring them over here.
That was the last of them.
The rest are dead.
I heard shouting up there.
Thunder.
I know the difference between shouting and thunder.
Maybe it's ghosts.
That won't help you, grandpa.
Where you riding?
Doesn't matter now, does it?
No, it doesn't matter now.
Cut his throat or he'll tell the crows we're here.
You understand.
Let me stand at least.
Let me go with a bit of dignity.
Make the crow kill him.
You're one of us now.
Prove it.
The wolves are out there.
I can't do it by choice.
I don't know how.
It happens in my dreams.
You're a warg, Bran.
It's in your blood.
I can't.
You just did with him.
A wolf is nothing compared to that.
She looks sharp.
Do it.
I told you.
He's still one of them.
Go on, boy.
Go on!
He's a crow.
He'll always be a crow.
And here's his crow wife guarding him.
He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
Kill him.
- He's one of them.
Do you hear me?
You're not gonna die for one of them.
They'll find us if you don't.
You were right the whole time.
Hyah!
When you hear a songbird's whistle, you come.
I'm a great whistler.
The greatest in the land.
Daario Naharis.
That one was quick.
- There may be others.
- I doubt it.
The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
That's what you call a few guards?
Come on!
What do you got, huh?
Lord Edmure...
I hope I'm not a disappointment to you.
You're a delight to me, my lady.
You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity.
Look upon each other and say the words.
Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger...
- I am hers...
- I am his...
- and she is mine...
- and he is mine... from this day until the end of my days.
- Is that safe?
- They're long gone.
You were right.
I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want.
Of course you can.
North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals.
But you did a lot more than that.
You got inside Hodor's mind.
They can't do that north of the Wall?
No one can do that...
anywhere.
When I was looking through Summer's eyes, I saw Jon.
- Where?
He was with the wildlings.
They tried to kill him, but he got away.
He'll be heading back to Castle Black, then.
That's where we should go.
For all we know, Castle Black's already under attack.
- If this many wildlings got through--
- I already told you.
I'm not going north of the Wall.
Everything Jojen told me is true.
You saw what I did to Hodor.
I have to find the three-eyed raven.
Listen to me, little lord.
I'm not asking you to come with me.
It won't be safe for Rickon.
Me?
I'm coming with you.
You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.
The Umbers are our bannermen.
They'll protect you.
I'm your brother.
I have to protect you.
Right now I have to protect you.
Robb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall.
If something happens to us, you're the heir to Winterfell.
Would you know how to find the Last Hearth?
You southerners build your big castles and you never move.
You're easy to find.
We're not southerners.
And I don't want to leave you.
Shh, shh.
Come here, little soldier.
You and me, we're gonna have some adventures.
You don't have to do any of this.
Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be.
Shh.
We'll be fine, you and me.
The Umbers are great warriors.
Even I heard about them growing up.
They'll teach you how to swing a sword.
I know how to swing a sword.
You're leaving now?
It's the middle of the night.
I learned to walk in darkness.
Say your good-byes, little man.
Keep this one safe.
He means the world to me.
We've been waiting a long time.
Haven't we?
I don't know, you tell me.
How long does it take to sack a city?
It was just as you said.
They did not believe until it was too late.
Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
And Daario Naharis?
The city is yours, my queen.
They're good, aren't they?
They ought to be because they cost enough.
Look at the crowd there.
He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun, and now look at him.
The gods love to reward a fool.
- Uncle.
He's my nephew.
I love him.
And he's a damned fool.
Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?
Never do, my lady.
Dulls the senses.
That's the point.
Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?
Aye.
Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry.
So I have a fat young bride.
I hope she makes you very happy.
Well, she's made me very rich.
Pardon, my lord, my lady.
I need to find a tree to piss on.
My mother's alone with Roose Bolton.
I should rescue her.
Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I've ever met.
Be kind.
She's finally starting to like you.
And I like her.
But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis playing my harp and you would be sitting over there eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand.
Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.
Striking your king is an act of treason.
No, don't.
Don't insult them.
The septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said, and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.
But they are not yet man and wife.
A sword needs a sheath.
And a wedding needs a bedding.
What does my sire say?
To bed!
If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them.
Go on!
Careful now, ladies.
Once you set that monster free, there's no caging him again.
Poor girl.
Every bride suffers the same.
I'm sure you endured yours with grace.
Oh, Ned forbade it.
He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night.
That is a very strange custom.
I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.
It seems normal to you?
It's a tradition.
Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage.
But there are other ways of providing proof.
Boy or girl?
But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him.
Oh, do you?
It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming.
Eddard.
Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
I do.
Go on, line 'em up!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?
Got salt pork for the feast.
The feast is over.
Doesn't sound like it's over.
If I tell you it's over, it's over.
Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here.
Got pig's feet, too.
Are you soft in the head?
Turn this cart around.
I feel I've been remiss in my duties.
I've given you meat and wine and music, but I haven't shown you the hospitality you deserve.
My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.
Robb!
You ready to head home to Winterfell, right?
Feast over yet, is it?
Aye, it's over.
Follow him.
Aim!
It's too late.
The King in the North arises.
Lord Walder!
Lord Walder, enough!
Let it end!
He is my son.
My first son.
Let him go and I swear that we will forget this.
I swear it by the old gods and new.
We will take no vengeance.
You already swore me one oath right here in my castle.
You swore by all the gods your son would marry my daughter!
Take me for a hostage, but let Robb go.
Robb, get up.
Get up and walk out.
Please!
And why would I let him do that?
On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife's throat.
I'll find another.
Mother.
The Lannisters send their regards.
Lord Bowser...
Our spies believe the King is still within the palace walls.
As well as the princess.
And what of her bodyguard?
We have a score to settle.
Leave him to me.
Very well.
Let the invasion begin!
Command we have a red alert-
Secure the roof!
Overwatch in place.
Rooftop secure.
Grenade!
Move out.
Clear.
Eastwing: secure.
Guard is down.
They're somewhere here.
Smoke 'em out!
It’s Bravo Team...
Something doesn't feel right here...
There should be more guys to shoot.
What if it's a trap?
Oh, you think everything's a trap.
Oh shit, it's Toad!
Take him out-
Your Majesty.
Princess.
Let's go.
Stay close.
Stop right th-
Wait wait wait!
Don't shoot!
Don’t shoot!
Your majesty...
We're completely surrounded.
I don't see another option but surrender.
Toad, is there another escape route?
There's a ventilation pipe at the end of the maintenance hall.
But it's too small for a man to fit through.
No...
Princess...
I need you to go with Toad now.
No, dad I'm not gonna leave you.
My beautiful daughter...
Sometimes a princess has to do what is right for her kingdom... as does a king.
This has been in our family for generations.
As long as you wear it...
I will be with you... keeping you safe.
Then you keep it... you stay safe.
I love you my daughter.
Never forget that.
I love you.
Toad.
You majesty...
It's been my greatest honor...to serve with you.
Princess...we need to go.
Come on...
Princess, let’s go...
Run!
Your orders sire?
We know what Bowser does with prisoners.
We won't be giving him any.
We fight to the end.
For the kingdom.
For the kingdom!
Still no sign of the target.
Bowser's gonna be pissed.
Bill's coming down.
Wait here.
Aw crap, that's just what we need.
Tell me where the girl is and I might let you live.
OK, you can go-
Princess, come on.
I have an idea.
Um...Toad?
Alright.
Off you go, Princess.
Toad...
What's going to happen to you?
Don't worry about me Princess.
Just get to the end of the pipe and keep going.
Don't let anyone know who you are If I get out of here alive, I'll find you.
I promise!
Now go!
Bill.
Now there won't be any question of who's the fastest gun in the mushroom kingdom.
There never was.
You never did know when to quit, Toad.
Not so fast!
This... is from the Princess.
AGHHHHHHH!!!!
ONE WEEK BEFORE INVASION DAY RESERVE FORCES ARE SETTING UP CHECKPOINTS IN MUSHROOM CITY AS TROOPS GATHER AT THE BORDER.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING YOU NEWS AS BOWSER'S AGRESSION MOVES CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM.
This war...it's bad for business.
We should be out there...fighting!
With what, our plungers?
Nah, we should join the army.
I mean, haven't you ever every wanted to be anything more than a plumber?
Hey!
I'm proud of being a plumber.
I mean, somebody's gotta fix these toilets!
You don't get it, do you, Mario!?
If Bowser wins this war, there won’t be any toilets left to fix.
There ain’t nothing wrong with being plumbers.
But this is our chance to be heroes...
Private Mario!
Private Luigi!
Command has seen fit to send you on a special mission!
People of the Mushroom Kingdom....
You can help us make more episodes by clicking on our Kickstarter link in the description!
Duke?
Testin' our accommodations.
Well, sorry to bother you, but Sam Verdreaux called.
He sounded good and sauced, but he wants us to know that he heard some kind of a bang.
Like a car backfired?
Or a bang like Tommy Anderson finally shot his wife?
He didn't specify.
But Sam's the only one that called it in, so I didn't want to overreact.
You were right to get me, Linda.
Never know with this damn place.
You off to the game today, Big Jim?
No, I'm sitting this one out, actually.
Aw.
I thought the whole town council always rode that stupid float together.
Working the lot today, so the guys...
let me sit this one out.
Heavy is the head that wears many hats.
I'm not sure that's quite how that one goes.
We're having a big sale on our pre-owns.
Hoping we're a little busier than here, no offense.
Sunday mornings have been brutal since they opened that Denny's over in Westlake.
I'll take your French toast any day of the week, Rose.
Jim...
what is this?
That's me buying your next vote.
Says the guy who always runs unopposed.
We're all in this together.
God!
I know, right?
No, you don't.
Angie...
Huh?
It's been a fun summer.
Ouch.
Junior, we both know what this is.
And you go back to school in a few days.
No, I'm not.
I'm, uh...
I'm dropping out.
I dropped out.
I'm done.
Are you insane?
You've never been.
Trust me, college is just another...
lame-ass pyramid scheme.
They hand you a free ride out of this place, and you just throw it away?
This-this is about us.
This is not about...
No, Angie, just listen to me for a second, all right?
I...
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey.
I have loved you since the third grade.
You're the only person in the whole world who knows the real me.
And that's why I can't be with you.
Look, I'm gonna be late for work.
Why are you acting like this?
Ow!
Mrs.
Grinnell?
Julia Shumway.
You wanted to see me in person?
So you're the newspaper woman?
I'm the new editor of The Independent, yeah.
But if you're just having a problem with your delivery, you can go ahead and...
I get my news online, sweetheart, like everybody else.
I called you because I got a tip.
About what?
See that truck?
That's its fourth propane delivery this week.
Last week, it made six.
Looks like someone's planning one hell of a barbecue.
Or...
Y-You think this might be connected to terrorism?
Like they say, "See something, say something."
Why tell me?
Why not the police?
I called Sheriff Perkins three days ago.
He...
said he'd look into it.
Turns out everything's above board.
Town hall is just restocking its emergency reserves.
Here's the thing: when Duke told me, he sounded nervous.
Believe me, that man's never sounded nervous a day in his life.
Okay.
I'll do some digging.
MRS.
GRINNELL: Whatever you find...
You leave my name the hell out of it.
Where the hell are they taking all our trucks?
Over to Westlake.
It's parade day.
I love you, too, Rusty!
DUKE: Never understand why you said yes to one of those meatheads.
'Cause their insurance policy makes ours look like crap.
MAN: No!
I'm headed back now.
Hey, listen...
so, we got a problem here.
Your guy...
"Smith" shows up, he doesn't have the money and then he tries to renegotiate.
Aggressively.
I gotta call you back.
Incoming.
No front tag.
This is 102.
Can you run a plate for us?
Boy Adam Boy, One Six Two.
Perfect.
Whoa, guys, wait.
Duke...
YOUNG MAN: You okay?
I saw your car spin out.
Wh-What happened?
Whoa.
Don't touch that.
Holy crap.
What the hell?!
Are you sure you're okay, Duke?
My damn pacemaker.
Must've skipped a beat.
And that's supposed to make me feel better?
I'm fine.
WOMAN: We have a problem here.
- All our landlines are dead.
- Okay.
Freddy here.
Paul here.
One at a time, geniuses.
Freddy, you go first.
Sorry, Duke.
We've got a downed power line over by the clinic.
Paul?
Yeah, same story across town at the Food Mart.
Sparks and everything.
What could cause that?
A twister?
It's some sort of invisible fence.
Like those ones for dogs?
Whatever it is, I'd probably stop touching it.
It only zaps you the first time.
It's like some sort of static electricity or...
Necks are snapped.
This thing must be crazy high.
Go!
Run!
What the hell is happening?
God Almighty, what are we looking at?
SALESMAN: Looks like a prop plane just exploded in midair.
A plane crash?
In Chester's Mill?
Is your phone getting any service?
Got nothing.
Let me see that.
It's Mrs.
Sanders.
From the bank.
She sponsored our Little League team.
No, no, no.
Stop the truck!
Wait-- if it crashes through, you're dead.
Why can't we hear the sirens?
No, no, no, stop!
What are you doing?
Tell 'em to...
call the FAA.
The Feds?
They got to shut down this whole airspace.
Uh, okay, what if the government built this thing?
I doubt it.
Why?
'Cause it works.
MAN: Sorry for the radio silence, folks.
Generator's cooking and we're up and running again.
I'm Phil Bushey, and you're listening to WYBS, the Mill's only 100% independent home of rock.
Phil.
Dodee, hey.
We're the only thing on air right now-- AM, FM, anywhere.
Yeah, the blackout, I know.
No, even if that were statewide, every station our size has its own generator, so...
why is the whole dial still static?
But our ratings are gonna be amazing.
DUKE: What the hell happened here?
Sheriff Perkins!
The plane smashed right into it.
I was almost killed.
Th-This man saved my life.
Slow down, son.
Slow down.
You hurt?
Uh, no, I think...
I think something just, uh, ipped me on the way down.
LINDA: Why aren't the guys putting out the fires?
DUKE: You saw it crash.
Into what?
I don't know, but, I mean, whatever this thing is, it is big.
YOUNG MAN: It's like a wall.
You just can't see it.
Rusty.
I don't think he can hear you.
Baby, you okay?
I-I can't hear you.
Step away from there, Linda.
I don't understand.
Watch your step, Jim.
That's Chuck Thomson's plane, isn't it?
Not anymore.
PAUL : Hey, Duke?
We got a real bad accident on Pretty Valley.
Duke, it's Freddy.
I've got one, too, over on Motton.
A minivan versus...
I don't know what, but the thing's flat as a dime.
Whole family's DOA.
LINDA: Whatever it is, it cut off all our roads.
Not just the roads...
the whole town.
We're trapped.
BIG JIM: Okay, here's what we got: There's 19 roads going in and out of Chester's Mill.
Not including the dirt ones.
Joe, would you go home and stay there?
DUKE: Paul and Freddy are setting up roadblocks here and over here, but it's gonna take some time to button up the whole town.
BIG JIM: Eh, do what you can.
I got a contingency plan.
No, no, no, Julia.
This is a crime scene.
JULIA: No.
Plane falls out of the sky, that's news.
BIG JIM: Hey!
I'm the ranking official here, and I'm ordering you to leave.
Jim!
We got bigger fish to fry.
Linda, you commandeer Ms.
Shumway's vehicle.
We'll cover more ground splitting up.
What the hell?
That's my car!
Who the hell are you?
Barbie.
People just call me Barbie.
Barbie?
It's a nickname.
Anyway, I'm not your story.
Then why don't you show me what is.
Am I doing something wrong?
Power's out, Carolyn.
Cashier said the pumps will be back on soon.
"Chester's Mill "is known for its rich, fertile land and warm, inviting people."
Please, these jerks don't even have orange juice.
- Guy said we'd have to wait till the next delivery.
CAROLYN: Alice, you didn't take your insulin without eating.
I'll be fine.
I got a candy bar.
No...
You need real food, honey.
We'll stop at that diner we passed.
Mom, seriously, can we please drive somewhere else?
I refuse to have my last meal here.
Norrie, you're not going to your execution; you're going to camp.
Camp?
It's like a glorified prison for screw-ups with rich parents.
ALICE: It's a great program, Norrie, and as soon as they say you're ready, you can come home again.
Los Angeles.
: Awesome.
We can stop for lunch later.
Where the hell did it come from?
I have no idea.
If this thing just appeared out of thin air, you think maybe it'll disappear, too?
Yeah, maybe.
You think we might be stuck in here a while.
I think that even if what's wrong suddenly becomes right, the Army's gonna quarantine this place.
So you're military, huh?
Not recently.
WOMAN : Help me.
Help me.
Help...
me.
JULIA: How did she...
She must've been reaching across when that thing came down.
JULIA: It's-it's okay.
My husband's a doctor.
We're gonna get you to the hospital.
I can't even grab a regular broadcast signal.
Phil, something bad is going on out there, okay?
It could be solar flares disrupting the entire grid.
Dodee!
The cable is out-- it doesn't mean it's the end times.
When roving packs of mutants start swarming this place, don't say I didn't tell you.
This is Councilman Rennie!
Open the damn door!
PHIL: I'm not supposed to let anyone inside while we're broad...
DODEE: What the hell?
You better have a warrant or we're gonna sue your ass for...
Young lady, you're gonna let me make an emergency broadcast right now or someone's gonna die.
: This is Councilman Rennie.
Uh, Big Jim Rennie.
But this isn't a car commercial.
Please stop what you're doing and listen.
This is an emergency broadcast.
We have a serious situation in town, and it's very important that every motorist listening to my voice stops their vehicle now.
You're the one who's addicted.
I use my phone for work, not for sending naked pictures of myself to random boys.
For the millionth time, that was an accident.
That's what you said when you knocked out that girl's tooth.
BIG JIM: Once again, every car needs to pull over immediately.
This is not a drill.
Did you hear that?
I can't tell you if what happened is an act of terror or an act of God, but I'll keep everyone updated as we learn more.
It's just some stupid viral marketing thing, Mom.
Norrie's right.
There are other people on the road.
It's probably just some stunt...
ALICE: Is everyone all right?
Nothing about this...
is all right.
Norrie?
Norrie!
Are you okay?!
Keep her head up.
The pink stars...
are...
falling.
The pink stars...
falling...
in lines.
The pink stars are falling in lines.
Mom?
Ange, where the hell is Mom?
You're the one who lives here.
Where's Dad?
Still on the road.
You're sure?
A guy at the diner said there might have been a chemical spill.
I was worried it was Dad's truck.
I came here as fast as I could.
Joe, what is it?
Mom's having brunch with Uncle Steve at Denny's.
And?
Angie, Denny's is in Westlake.
That's on the other side of this thing.
We're on our own.
Let's go!
Okay!
MAN: Let's go!
MAN 2: Fracture over here, guys.
MAN: Mrs.
Shumway, thank God.
Is the doc with you?
He's not here?
Peter always works Sundays.
Ma'am, your husband hasn't worked Sundays in weeks.
He probably just went home.
I should go check on him.
REPORTER: The governor contacted you?
REPORTER 2: We just need some answers.
What's caused this?
Please, we need some ans...
WOMAN: We need a wheelchair over here.
MAN: A little help?
Can I bum one?
Little young to be a nurse, aren't you?
Just a lowly candy striper.
So, you saw whatever did all this?
I mean, what there is to see, yeah.
Some of the patients are saying it's like we're...
stuck in a giant fishbowl.
I used to have fish.
Goldfish.
But then, one of them got sick, and the other one...
The other one ate him.
Did you even know they did that?
Goldfish?
Want something for that?
I just want to get out of here.
You and me both.
CAROLYN: Help!
Please, we need help!
Our daughter's had some sort of episode.
It was a damn seizure, Alice.
Come on, let's get her looked at.
Watch your head.
All right.
Just go in right there.
Looks like a ghost town in here.
BIG JIM: Yeah, no word from anyone else on the council yet, but, uh, I should be able to hold down the fort.
It's easier to reach consensus when there's only one voice to listen to, right?
Anyway, I appreciate what you did on the radio today.
You saved some lives.
Ah, just doing my job and all.
How your men holding up?
We're spread thin since most of them are at the damn parade, but we'll soldier on.
Well, for now you will, but, uh, what happens if this thing lasts for days or-or weeks?
Well, we might need more manpower to maintain the peace.
What are you getting at, Jim?
Well, during emergencies, uh, councilmen have the power to authorize additional police officers.
The last thing this mess needs is amateurs with badges.
Till I hear otherwise from the mayor or above, you're not authorizing anything.
Understood.
Good.
What do we do when the people start asking about the propane?
Well, that has nothing to do with this.
Oh, I know that, but some people might find it hard to swallow that we just happened to be stockpiling fuel right before a disaster.
So, should we tell them the truth?
That's your business.
I have no idea what the hell you wanted with all that crap.
Oh.
You were more than happy to turn a blind eye, but...
you're not dumb.
I did what I had to do to keep this town from going broke, to keep it safe.
Oh, careful, Duke.
You don't want to put too much stress on that bum ticker of yours, now, do you?
Are you threatening me?
Oh, just reminding you what the lay of the land is.
Regular receivers can't pull a signal through whatever has-has cut us off, but I once used our broadcast tower like a giant antenna to pull feedback loops for my band's cover album.
Dodee, just tell me what you heard.
This.
It sounds alien?
Sounds more Bjork.
It-it comes and goes like that.
Sometimes it's music, sometimes, cell phone conversations.
It just...
MAN: Army Corps of Engineers' best guess puts the dome over Chester's Mill at roughly, uh, 20,000 feet...
Did he just call it a dome?
JUNIOR: Sorry.
I didn't mean to sneak up on you like that.
I'm Junior.
Hey, um...
do we know each other?
Doubt it.
You sure?
Something about you just looks so familiar.
I'm talking to you, dumb ass.
Look...
I don't know what I did to piss you off, but I promise you, you don't want to start something here.
What if I do?
Everything all right out here?
Hey, Mrs.
S.
Everyone's been very welcoming.
JUNIOR: Be seeing you.
What the hell was that about?
Any word from your husband?
He wasn't back home, so...
now, I've been checking all the roadblocks.
This was the last one.
At least he wasn't one of the crashes.
Where you off to?
Oh, the motels are all booked up, so, I'm just gonna rough it.
Don't be ridiculous.
You can stay with Peter and me.
Uh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Linda said you saved a kid's life today.
I'm not about to let you sleep out here like an animal.
I insist.
BOY: McAlister.
It's Ben-- Ben Drake from AP English?
Hey, man.
Hey, so is it true-- are you seriously home alone?
Man, your house parties are gonna be sick.
So, have you touched the force field thing?
Whatley says it's straight out of Star Trek.
You looking for something?
Yeah, an off switch.
This thing couldn't have just appeared out of thin air.
Whatever it is-- it's got to have its own power source, right?
I guess.
What if that power source was somewhere in here with us?
Maybe it's somewhere nearby, distributing juice to the entire thing.
Joe?
Joe!
The pink stars are falling.
You all right, man?
Hey, let's get some help!
Help, someone help!
Get over here right now!
Hey, hey!
If you do everything I say, I promise you won't get hurt, okay?
Help, help, help, help!
Angie, I'm...
I'm so sorry, Ange.
I didn't want it to go like this.
I'm afraid I...
I have some hard news.
Some folks are still unaccounted for, but it looks like Chester's Mill...
lost 12 of her own today.
ROSE: Duke...
what the hell is going on?
Isn't it obvious?
We're under attack.
DUKE: Nobody knows a damn thing, so there's no point in spreading any rumors.
Please, our daughter is sick.
We need to get her to a real doctor.
I mean, even if they can't knock that wall down, they can still airlift her out of here.
Well, I don't know, but if those eggheads out there can drop a car on Mars, they sure as hell can figure this out, too.
When everybody gets home tonight, I want you to check on your neighbors, and if anybody needs anything, you know where to find me.
Hey, Angie.
Help!
Somebody help me!
Stop it, quiet down, stop.
Oh, God, please help me!
Save your voice, babe.
Okay?
No one can hear us all the way down here.
Down?
My dad's old fallout shelter.
He's always been a little paranoid about security, but...
you're safe now.
What are you talking about?
I finally figured it out-- why you were acting so strange this morning.
It's all connected.
I know how this must look, but...
I swear, in the long run, you're gonna thank me for this.
Oh, my God, you've lost your mind.
No, no.
I'm the only person who understands what's really going on around here.
All I ask for...
is patience.
Let go of me!
Let me out of here!
Get me out, get me out!
Junior!
MAN: Junior.
Dad.
Where you been?
Heard you on the radio.
It sounded like we might need the old shelter, but it's completely flooded.
Oh, tha-that's the least of our worries.
All that matters is you're okay.
Whatever this is, I want to help.
I appreciate that, but you got school...
School is out there, I'm here, and I want to help.
Honey, are you home?
How do you guys have power?
Backup generator.
Big Jim convinced my husband it would be a tax write-off when we moved in here.
That's Peter behind you.
You must think I'm an idiot.
Wha-What do, what do you mean?
Journalist who doesn't know what's going on under her own nose.
I'm sure the whole town's thinking it.
My husband isn't here because he's having an affair.
They don't know him like I do.
He'll turn up, you'll see.
I can't wait to meet him.
Come on, I'll give you the nickel tour.
I was supposed to be with Rusty today, at the game.
Told him if we were ever going to afford a honeymoon, we both had to put in more overtime.
Why Chester's Mill?
Why us?
Maybe we're being punished.
Sorry?
You're good police, Linda.
But...
there's a lot I've tried to protect you from about this place.
Like what?
Little over a year ago, I was approached about...
My chest.
Duke, is it your pacemaker?
Duke, don't!
Duke, Duke!
Officer down!
Duke, come on, stay with me, Duke.
Duke, stay with me.
Help u...!
MALE REPORTER: We've spoken with the government, law enforcement, the military.
No one has any idea what's going on.
The closest I can come to an answer is to share with you the words of one scientist we spoke to today.
He told us, and I'm quoting, "This is an unparalleled..."
FEMALE REPORTER: "This is an unparalleled event in human history."
Those are not the words of comfort, not to the nation or the world, certainly not to the people of Chester's Mill, who appear to be trapped.
Best watched using Open Subtitles MKV Player Invisible, indestructible, and completely inescapable.
We don't know where it came from or why it's here, but now that we're all trapped under the dome together, none of our secrets are safe.
Who the hell are you?
People just call me Barbie.
It's a nickname.
My husband isn't here, but he'll turn up, you'll see.
What do we do when the people start asking about the propane?
Junior.
You can stay with me.
Where is it?
I don't have it!
My boss is not gonna like that.
You got one day.
Listen, all you've got to do is pay up.
You might want to think about it, all right?
I mean, you don't want to do anything stupid.
You all right?
Yep.
You were, uh, talking in your sleep.
Yelling, actually.
Is that thing still out there?
Yeah, looks like it.
The Hazmat suits haven't left.
Julia...
thanks again for letting me crash here.
With my husband missing, and everything that happened today...
it was nice to have the company.
I'll see you in the morning.
Did you lose something?
You didn't happen to see a pair of dog tags around anywhere, did you?
But I'll keep an eye out.
Night.
Linda!
What the hell happened?
Who shot Duke?
No one shot Duke, Paul.
Calm down.
He just got close to this thing, and his pacemaker exploded.
Ah!
Holy...
If this thing blows up mechanical things, then why didn't Freddy's watch explode?
It's a wind-up.
It must only affect things with batteries.
Either way, just check the roadblocks and make sure nobody gets near this thing.
Well, who's in charge now?
You're a cop.
Do your job.
What about me?
We need to take care of Duke.
Joe, wait up!
No, you're not.
An hour ago, you were having a seizure, flopping around like a fish on a hook.
Did I say anything?
Yeah, something about...
stars.
Pink stars.
Anything you want to tell me?
Any luck, you guys?
No, not yet!
This thing goes down far.
Oh, my God, you know what all this means?
We're so not having that trig test tomorrow.
Trig.
That's a great idea.
It is?
I can totally map this thing, see if there's any holes.
Dude, you don't have to.
Buddy, Lewis had Clark, you got me, all right?
Say...
did you hear anything more about the military - on that contraption of yours?
- Nope.
I lost the signal, but I'm trying to get it back.
It's not as easy as cuing up the next Van Halen track.
Now, why is it that engineers always act superior to DJs?
Because we're smarter, Phil.
Negative, sir, fire is ineffective against the surface.
But we can confirm there is no radioactivity emanating from the dome.
They did it again.
Second time in 24 hours they called it a dome.
Yeah, I heard him.
No, I don't think you did, because you'd be freaking out, too.
We're under a dome, Dodee.
Now, this is not just some invisible wall where a chopper can drop in and rescue us, man.
We gotta tell people.
And we will.
It's just right now we only know enough to scare the crap out of them.
To be continued.
Faithful insomniacs, Phil Bushey here.
It's been a long night.
And if you're listening to me, it's because you've got no choice.
You see, this barrier thing is blocking all of the cell phones, TV, Internet...
everything in our humble burg of Chester's Mill.
Now, theories about what's causing this range from the North Koreans to a breach in the space-time continuum...
Well, sorry I didn't get to you sooner, Rose.
Had to make sure the clinic and the nursing home were taken care of.
Are you kidding me?
If you're not careful, people are gonna start calling you Santa Claus.
Oh, God bless you, Jim Rennie.
How much do I owe you?
Ho, ho, ho.
The lights are back.
Did that invisible wall come down?
Well, I'm afraid not.
But, uh, we've got gennies up and running, so we have some power, at least get back to some sense of normal.
I don't believe we've met.
Councilman Jim Rennie, this is Carolyn and, uh, her partner Alice.
They're staying in my spare room upstairs.
They're in from L.A.
We got trapped driving through your little town.
We were taking our daughter Norrie to...
To camp.
But we have to get out of here.
Our daughter is sick.
She had a seizure.
Does your girl have epilepsy?
It can happen to anyone.
Caffeine, sleep deprivation.
I've seen it in my patients.
She's a psychiatrist.
Well, I'm sorry you ladies aren't discovering Chester's Mill under better circumstances, but trust me, if you're gonna be stuck somewhere, this is the place to be.
I've lived here my entire life, and, uh...
No place I'd rather call home.
Jim.
I need you to come with me.
Duke's dead.
Look at me, damn it!
Anyone?
I wouldn't even bother.
I mean, you could strip naked in front of these guys, they're still not gonna pay attention.
I tried that an hour ago.
They didn't even blink.
I looked around, by the way, but no sign of your dog tags.
Oh, yeah, no worries.
You know what?
I probably just left them in my car.
So what makes you think these guys are under orders not to talk to us?
Because they're not talking to us.
Maybe they did this, you know.
Maybe they're responsible.
And why would they do that?
Could be, uh, an experiment.
Some sort of portable detention camp.
Maybe we're being used as guinea pigs.
Whatever it is, these guys are the reason my husband is trapped out there!
ere you heading?
The radio station.
They might not be talking to us, but they are talking to somebody.
I told you, you're safe with me.
Mr.
Rennie!
my dad's not home.
My dad's not home!
Let go!
no!
No!
N...
Get...
off.
What the hell do you want from me?
Look, I just want you to go back to being the Angie I knew before yesterday.
We were doing great, and then this thing comes down and you...
you tell me to take a hike.
I think it scrambled your brain.
One of us has a scrambled brain, all right.
You can't see it, but I can.
You're sick, Angie.
But I'm gonna make you better.
If I'm so sick, then why don't you take me to the hospital?
If you care about me so much?
Because he might still be there.
Who might still be here?
The guy I saw you with.
What guy?
Yesterday?
Outside the hospital?
The guy who came in with Mrs.
Shumway?
I don't even know him.
Don't play dumb with me, Ange, I can see right through you.
All he did was give me a cigarette.
Uh-huh.
What did I ever do to you?!
You loved me.
Junior...
I never...
Yes, Angie, you did.
And when this thing comes down, you're gonna love me again.
I will never love you!
That guy...
at the hospital, we didn't just share a cigarette.
He screwed my brains out, and I loved it.
I loved it more than I ever did with you.
You'll never be the man that he is.
Holy hell.
He was a good man.
I loved him.
He was like a father to me.
He was a good friend.
You know, just before he died, he tried to tell me something.
Tried telling you what?
He said there were things that I didn't know about Chester's Mill.
Things that he needed to protect me from.
What did that mean?
I wish I could tell you.
What am I gonna do with another body?
The cemetery is outside the barrier, and my freezer's full.
Show some respect.
This isn't just another body.
This is Duke Perkins.
Turn up your hearing aid, Lester.
I said this is Duke Perkins.
Oh, no.
Oh, good Lord.
He's Duke Perkins.
Deputy Esquivel, I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you, Reverend Coggins.
I should get back out there.
Well, you're right, Linda.
Go out there and do your job.
I'll make sure Duke here gets taken care of.
You're using our stuff.
You're high as a kite.
It's Judgment Day, Jim.
I might as well be feeling the Rapture.
The only reason we got into this was to try to save Chester's Mill.
That's the reason Duke went along with it.
You and I, we had other priorities.
I mean...
I mean, at least now, we don't have to worry about him talking.
Real man of God there, Rev.
Come on, let's go.
Where are we going?
Clean up our mess.
Dude, found a way out.
Check it.
You're such an idiot.
It's Joe, right?
Yeah, McAlister.
Dude, this is the guy who saved my ass when that plane went down.
He totally said it was raining arms and legs.
Yeah, you could say that.
What are you up to?
So far, I marked these points, and by measuring the distance between them, I was able to come up with the Y coordinate, and then by multiplying it by its K integer...
He connected the dots.
It's totally gonna be circle.
So far, it looks like it's about ten miles across.
It covers the entire Mill, including some of Lake Eastpointe.
And you did this?
Yeah, but we're being really careful.
Keep it up.
Where'd that guy come from?
Definitely not from around here.
How do you know?
'Cause he's cool.
Come on, Dodee, you just had him.
Patience, Philip.
Did you get something?
Air traffic has been rerouted around Chester's Mill until further notice.
Continue to monitor the airspace.
What the hell is that?
I was, um, looking for that.
It's Duke's will.
Go ahead, read it.
He, uh, left me his house.
Everything.
Of course he did.
He treated you like the daughter he never had.
Now what do we do?
It was a close call.
No thanks to you.
What was I supposed to do, phone you?
So what'd you find out?
Nothing to do with propane.
Duke must have kept the records at his house.
Yeah, but it's not his house anymore.
He left it to the girl.
So you better get over there before she does.
What are you gonna do?
My job, Lester.
Now get out.
I'm the only councilman left in Chester's Mill.
I got a town to take care of.
You made this?
Yeah, I'm only three credits short of my master's degree in electrical engineering.
Wow.
How does it work?
Well, this is a harmonic microwave frequency converter.
It turns low frequency waves into high frequency waves so that we can hear them.
Maybe you should just let me hear it?
Um, sometimes it's hard to pick up.
Further tests reveal dome appears to be impervious to high energy lasers and all class-A corrosive chemicals.
We're under a dome.
Yeah, that's what they keep calling it.
Why haven't you told anybody?
We're not a news station.
Hey, Phil?
And that was some face-melting rock and roll brought to you by...
I'm going on.
I tried to stop her.
I'm sorry, what are you doing?
I'm going on the air.
No, you can't.
This is Julia Shumway from the weekly Independent.
I have some news for all of us stuck here inside Chester's Mill.
I have just learned that the barrier around Chester's Mill is being called a dome.
This information appears to be coming from military sources positioned just outside Chester's Mill, just outside the dome.
We will keep updating you as information comes in.
So stay tuned to...
WYBS.
Your only source of news from under the dome.
What does that mean?
I do, Mom.
It means we're all gonna die in here.
This dome thing, how big is it?
No idea.
We're under a dome?
Are we gonna run out of air?
Until I find out where Julia got this information, I think it's best that we just all stay calm.
What if it collapses on us?
Great, now the sky is falling.
If we keep our heads and we stick together, we'll get through this.
Hey, "We'll get through this"?
You don't know what this dome thing might do.
You're right, but the last thing we need right now is for people to panic.
That thing took Duke.
Who's next?
Pull yourself together and get out on patrol.
People are scared, and when people are scared, they start acting stupid.
Yeah, you'd have to be stupid not to be scared.
You know, I just hope someone tries to blow this damn thing up.
Do you think he's gonna be okay?
He's got to be.
We're gonna need every man we got.
Think we'll ever see him again?
Who, Rusty?
Come on, Linda.
My brother's not gonna let some magic bubble thing keep him from seeing you again.
Yeah, that is Rusty.
Hey, you know what?
I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but he's taking you to Hawaii for your honeymoon.
That dog told me that I had to settle for Niagara Falls.
Reverend.
How you holding up?
We got our hands full, but I think we'll make it.
Yeah, you're in my prayers.
Julia Shumway, back with an update.
Additional reports suggest that the dome is not radioactive, but residents are advised to continue to keep a safe distance.
And now, something to take our minds off all this trouble.
Hey, stop!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm digging my way out.
Any machine touches that dome, you're fried.
Says who?
Duke.
His pacemaker blew right out of his chest.
He's dead.
Duke's dead?
Who's in charge?
What if we're trapped in here forever?
I'll never get to make out with Mila Kunis.
I don't think this thing is the only thing keeping that from happening.
Just think about it.
We could have met every girl we're ever gonna meet.
That is so depressing.
They're doing tests.
Must be checking to see if water can come through.
Doesn't look good.
We're screwed.
Wait.
It's like a sieve.
What the hell's a sieve?
A strainer, douche.
Like-like for pasta?
So it does let water through?
Yeah, just a little.
Maybe we can get through.
Aren't we, like, 70% water?
Yeah, it's the other 30% that's the problem, genius.
This and, uh, can you give me a pack of filtered?
Actually, you know what?
Make it three.
No, that's it.
Didn't anyone ever tell you smoking's bad for you?
Hey, no, these-these aren't for me.
It's an investment.
We end up getting stuck in here for a while, you would be surprised what people will swap for these things.
So I'd probably hang onto that candy bar if I were you.
What's wrong?
You had it working before.
It's not like punching in the presets on your car radio.
This takes finesse.
Finesse, my ass.
She's just diddling.
Sometimes she gets lucky.
Further tests reveal the dome appears to be impervious to high-energy laser.
How's that for lucky?
This is Mobile Ground Unit 2.
After exhaustive testing we are unable to determine the origin or the composition of the dome.
Oh, my God, the military doesn't know what it is.
So?
So it means they didn't do it.
They're not responsible.
Who is?
Empty.
What have you got there?
Why are you following me?
So, this is where you did it.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
This is where you screwed her.
I know all about you and Angie.
Who's Angie?
Don't act like you don't know.
Looks like she put up a pretty good fight.
She belongs to me.
That's too bad for her.
She still belongs to me.
You just stay the hell away from me.
Or what?
The next time, I'm not gonna stop.
Ah...
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
Ah-ah!
Lord, help!
Aw, man.
His master must've been right here.
Someone must've dragged the rest of the body away.
Poor fella.
The dog's the poor fella?
I kind of feel sorrier for the cut-in-half dude.
His name's Truman.
What're we gonna do with him?
We can't just leave him here.
A fire.
Let's go check it out.
Come on, Truman!
You almost killed us!
I got something for you.
Paul, what are you thinking?
This town is one click away from total and complete lawlessss.
When the time comes, I'm ready, and you should be, too.
We're on the same side here.
Yeah, for now.
Who the hell are you?!
Easy.
That's the guy that saved the McAlister kid when the plane crashed in the dome.
Linda, you there?
Get out here so I can see you.
Come here.
Go ahead, Jackie.
Sarah Martin just drove over.
She says there's a fire at 223 Pretty Valley Road.
Oh, my God, that's Duke's house.
Get every warm body out there to help.
You can kiss it good-bye-- the entire Chester's Mill's fire department's out there and we're in here.
Put that rifle down and get your ass to Duke's.
You're not my boss.
Now.
You, warm body.
Get in.
Any fire trucks still here?
Rusty and his buddies took them all to Westlake for that damn parade.
Clear the line and get to Duke's.
Damn it, Coggins.
Where's the fire department?
Right over here!
Right now, they're coming.
Hey, stay back!
Stay back!
Somebody, somebody help me!
Get out of the way!
What are you doing here?
I heard it on the scanner.
I'm just glad Duke lived alone.
Everyone, please stand back.
Keep a safe distance.
We have to put this out.
How the hell are we gonna do that?
You guys still got your water pressure, right?
So, go and get as many garden hoses as you can.
Go.
Go-go-go-go-go-go.
Hey, guys, we need hoses.
Go get water.
Whose got a hose?
Whose is that right there?
Grab your hose!
Excuse me.
Brian, your hose!
Backyard!
It hasn't rained in weeks.
We're inside a damn tinderbox.
If those flames spread to any of these other houses, it's gonna take Chester's Mill and us with it.
Hey, everybody who does not have a garden hose, I want you to go get a bucket, get a pot, get-get a trash can, something.
Anything that can hold water.
Let's go, get buckets!
Help.
Please help me!
Someone's inside.
Anybody in here?!
Hello?!
- You okay?
What the hell was Coggins doing in Duke's house?
Where did Jim go?
- Get out of here, guys.
There's a propane tank next to the house.
Oh, my God, that's a propane tank!
Let's go, let's go, get out of here.
Come on, get him out.
Go, go!
The flames are too high.
The hoses aren't cutting it.
The fire is spreading to the shrubs.
Get another hose over there.
There's not enough water pressure.
Can you imagine our neighbors back in Brentwood helping out this way?
I don't even know who our neighbors are.
We got to go faster.
Vic, you holding up all right?
Come on, guys, that's right.
Just like that.
We got to get more water on this thing, all right?
Keep going.
Keep going, everyone.
We got to get more water.
Faster, faster.
Keep at it, people.
The fire is spreading to the fence.
The house will be next.
Deputy, give me a hand.
Over there, the bottom of the fence.
Bottom of the fence.
Get more buckets!
Get some buckets in here.
The car's on fire.
Guys, back, everybody back.
This isn't gonna work.
It's like playing Whac-a-Mole.
As long as Duke's house is burning, the fire is just gonna keep jumping.
Then it's over.
Or not.
Hey, make some room!
Clear the street.
Get out of the street.
Hey, back up.
Everybody get back.
What the hell is Big Jim doing?
Is he insane?
He's gonna tear down Duke's house.
What the hell happened to you?
I took care of your boyfriend.
My boyfriend?
The guy you've been screwing.
Killed him.
No, you didn't.
He's dead, Angie.
He's never gonna touch you ever.
Why not?
I've known you since the third grade, James.
Even you couldn't do something that terrible.
That's my Angie.
I brought you something.
This is what we're working for.
Bucket brigade.
Pretty clever.
You weren't too shabby yourself.
Why, thank you.
Dale.
Dale Barbara.
I'm guessing that's you.
Guilty.
Where'd you find them?
Uh, you know what, they were actually just right there, where I left them, just hanging over the mirror in you bathroom.
Huh.
That's the first place I checked.
I must have missed them.
How's he doing?
It's lucky Linda got to him when she did.
Took in a lot of smoke, but I think he's gonna pull through.
Mind if I have a moment with him?
What the hell you thinking?
You told me to clean up our mess.
You call this cleaning it up?
How is he?
Well, there's someone up there watching over him.
Thank you for saving me.
You're welcome, but what in the world were you doing in there?
I was, uh... getting a suit for Duke's funeral.
I switched on a light, and then I can't really remember the rest.
Must have been a gas leak.
The dome's right there in Duke's backyard.
Probably, uh, severed a line.
Well, we're just all glad you're okay, Reverend.
Bless you, child.
Linda, thank you for saving the reverend.
I'm just...
I'm just doing my job.
Thank you, everyone, for a job well done.
Well, we couldn't have done it without you, Big Jim.
I appreciate that, but, uh, this isn't about me.
It's about all of us.
We stood together, shoulder to shoulder, like a town should in times like these.
Now, this is not gonna be the last crisis that Chester's Mill faces, but we'll get through the next one with the same courage and solidarity that we showed today.
Thank you all.
Like hell we will.
Go ahead, pat yourselves on the backs all you want, but we're toast.
Great, you can put out a fire.
That thing...
that thing is trapping smoke, and there's no way out.
Hey, come on, man.
Take it easy, Paul.
Back up.
Don't you tell me to take it easy.
You know, you're just like him.
You know, like, you're lying to these people, and you're promising that everything is gonna be okay, and it's not gonna be okay!
This thing is never gonna go away, and we're all gonna die!
Paul, don't!
Oh, no, no, Freddy!
Freddy?
Freddy, stay with me.
Freddy!
Breathe, stay with me, come on.
Stay with me, Freddy.
Freddy, Freddy.
LINDA: We don't know where it came from JULIA: Who the hell are you?
BARBIE: Barbie.
BIG JIM: What do we do when the people BEN: Joe, wait up!
JOE: Hey!

FREDDY: We got to go faster.
LINDA: Keep at it, people.
FREDDY: Hey, back up.
ROSE: Linda, BIG JIM: I appreciate that, FREDDY: Hey.
Chester's Mill is a place like any other.
At least, it used to be...
until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome.
and completely inescapable.
We don't know where it came from or why it's here, but now that we're all trapped under the dome together, none of our secrets are safe.
- Junior.
- Dad.
- Where is it?
- I don't have it!
If this thing blows up mechanical things, Now, why is it that engineers always act superior to DJs?
- Yeah, I heard him.
- No, I don't think you did, We were taking our daughter Norrie to...
- To camp.
my husband is trapped out there!
Where you heading?
- Mr.
- Angie...
- my dad's not home.
Don't play dumb with me, Angie, I never...
- Yes, Angie, you did.
I might as well be feeling the rapture.
- before she does.
and all class-8 corrosive chemicals.
- brought to you by...
- I'm going on.
This is Julia Shumway from the Weekly Independent.
- Are we gonna run out of air?
- Until I find out And now, something to take our minds off all this trouble.
- Says who?
- Duke.
It's not like punching in the presets on your car radio.
- How's that for lucky?
- FOB 1.
After exhaustive testing we are unable to determine the origin This town is one click away from total and complete lawlessness.
You can kiss it good-bye- the entire Chester's Mill's - What happened?
- I have no idea.
- Go.
- Whose got a hose?
- Help.
- Someone's inside.
- Come on, get him out.
- Go, go!
The fire is spreading to the shrub.
We need another hose over there.
There is not enough water presure.
You imagine our neighbour back in Briarwood helping out this way?
I don't even know who our neighbours are.
thank you for saving the Reverend.
- Hey, come on, man.
- Take it easy, Paul.
Translated by REPLACE WITH YOUR NAME.
Reporting for duty sir!
Ready to kick some Koopa Ass!
At 0500, Bowser's airships dropped two atomic ba-bombs on Yoshi's Island.
Emperor Yoshi has surrendered unconditionally.
The Mushroom Kingdom is the last nation standing between Bowser and complete annihilation.
Make no mistake men.
Most of you will die in this war.
But we have a secret weapon more powerful than the whole Koopa Empire.
Plungers.
Our freedom Oh yeah.
Command has seen fit to send you on a special mission.
Gear up!
Yeah, this sucks.
What are you talking about, Luigi?
Look at us, the Mario Brothers...
fixing toilets in the Royal Palace.
This is every plumber's dream!
It's too bad pops can't see us now.
I didn't sign up to plunge toilets, I signed up to kill Koopas!
And here we are in the safest place in the Mushroom Kingdom!
It's about damn time...
Tango!
Luigi!
Mario, you're gonna be OK!
It was just a flash bang!
Drop the weapon!
I said drop the - screw it!
You...bastards.
Put him in the truck.
He's going to the Brothers.
What do we do with this one?
The Hammer Brothers said they only need one.
Waste him!
Sarge...
Look out.
Mario...
You've gotta get out of here.
But...
Forget the toilets...
They got your brother.
Luigi?
The...
Hammer...
Brothers...
Ugh, gross.
Hammer Base Well, well, look at you two ladies.
What, are you gonna give me a manicure?
Quiet!
Aw, look at the little camera.
Isn't that cute?
Oops!
What is wrong with you?
You're going to pay for that!
Shut him up!
Did I hit your little - OOF!
Alright, alright.
I won't kick it over.
Ohhh!
Would you stop that already!
Shut up!
Look, they give me the creeps.
That's all I'm saying.
Watch your mouth soldier, or you'll end up in their next video.
Look, I just want to finish this mission and get home.
These two Shygirl...
Well, they weren't so shy if you know what I mean.
Take this for a second!
Aw come one, I'm ready for my close up!
Stop it!
Ooh, my meatballs!
Stop laughing you idiot.
Action.
People of the Mushroom Kingdom...
For too long we've felt the oppression of your boots upon our backs - BORING!
Guys, guys, guys...
I don't mean to tell you your business here, but this movie sucks!
Shutup!
Don't use that part.
There he is!
Get him!
Who's out there?
It's me, Mario - OHH!
LUIGI!
Now you will all witness the fury of Bowser's Army.
Guys, guys...
What's my line again?
I can still kick your ass with my other leg!
Ow!!!
Game over, plumber.
Hold on, Luigi.
This man was foolish enough to defy us.
Now he will pay the ultimate price.
Down with the Mushroom Kingdom.
All glory to Bowser!
You picked the wrong plumber, pal.
Mario, lookout!
Mario, stop messing around.
Oohhhh!
My meatballs!
I got him!
I got him, Mario!
You get the other one!
Yeah, that's right!
Come on Luigi.
I'm getting you out of here.
I was just about to kick their asses.
I know you were.
Luigi, come on!
I'm sorry brother.
This was a one way ticket for me.
I can't feel...
I can't feel my balls!
I'm not leaving here without you.
Now you listen to me!
You got to get out of here.
I ain't losing a brother today!
That makes two of us!
Hurry up, Mario.
Can't you go any faster?
Luigi...
Um, not so much jiggling.
My balls...
I swear to god, Luigi.
I swear to god!
Careful, Mario.
This is Donkey Kong Country.
The One Where It All Began There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.
You're going out with the guy.
There has to be something wrong with him.
All right, Joey.
Be nice.
So does he have a hump and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
I don't want her to go through what I did with Carl.
Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.
It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.
Sounds like a date to me.
I'm in high school, in the cafeteria... and I realize I'm totally naked.
I've had that dream.
Then I look down and I realize there is a phone... there.
-Instead of...
-That's right!
Never had that one.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
What do I do?
Everyone starts looking at me.
They weren't looking at you before?
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it.
And it turns out it's my mother.
Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.
Hi.
He says, "Hello," I want to kill myself.
I feel like someone pulled my intestine out of my mouth...
-...and tied it around my neck.
-Cookie?
Carol moved her stuff out today.
-Let me get you some coffee.
-Thanks.
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.
-Just leave my aura alone, okay?
-Fine, be murky.
-I'll be fine.
I hope she'll be happy.
-No, you don't.
No, I don't.
To hell with her.
She left me!
You never knew she was a lesbian?
Why does everyone keep fixating on that?
She didn't know.
How should I know?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
Did I say that out loud?
I told Mom and Dad last night.
They took it pretty well.
Oh, really?
So that hysterical phone call from a woman sobbing...
"I'll never have grandchildren," was what?
A wrong number?
Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.
You're angry.
You're hurting.
Can I tell you what the answer is?
Strip joints!
Hey, you're single.
Have some hormones.
But I don't want to be single, okay?
I just want to be married again.
And I just want a million dollars!
-Rachel?
-Oh, Monica!
Thank God!
I went to your building...
And a guy with a hammer said you'd be here, and you are.
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.
Everybody, this is Rachel, a Lincoln High survivor.
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe...
Joey.
Remember my brother, Ross?
Sure!
You want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.
I was in the room with all the presents...
And I was looking at this really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
When all of a sudden...
Sweet 'N Low?
I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than Barry.
I got freaked out, and it hit me: How much Barry looks like Mr.
Potato Head.
I always knew he looked familiar, but...
I had to get out of there, and I started wondering...
"Why am I doing this," and "Who am I doing it for?"
I didn't know where to go, and I know we've drifted apart...
But you're the only person I know here.
-Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
-I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.
I guess he bought her the pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
"Tuna or egg salad!
Decide!"
"I'll have whatever Christina's having."
Daddy, I just...
I can't marry him.
I just don't love him.
Well, it matters to me!
"If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off."
She should not be wearing those pants.
Push her down the stairs!
Push her!
Come on, Daddy, listen!
All my life, everyone's always told me, "You're a shoe!"
"You're a shoe!"
What if I don't want to be a shoe?
What if I want to be a purse?
Or a hat?
No, I don't want you to buy me a hat!
It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Look, Daddy, it's my life.
Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.
Well, maybe that's my decision.
Maybe I don't need your money.
Wait!
I said maybe!
Just breathe.
That's it.
Try to think of nice, calm things.
Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens La la la something And noodles with string I'm all better now.
I helped.
This is probably for the best.
Independence.
Controlling your life.
The whole hat thing.
You can always come to Joey.
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
He's away a lot.
Stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.
Like there's a rule, or something?
I got it.
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.
It's Paul.
Oh, God, is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.
-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy?
Your "not a real date" is with Paul, the wine guy?
-He finally asked you out?
-Yes!
It's a "Dear Diary" moment.
-Rach, I can cancel.
-Please, go, I'll be fine.
Ross, are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?
That'd be good.
-Really?
-Go on!
It's Paul, the wine guy!
Does he sell it, drink it?
Or he just complains a lot?
Hi, come in!
Paul, this is... everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.
-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name.
I'll be right back.
I've just gotta go...
A-wandering?
Change.
Sit down.
Two seconds.
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.
Hey, Paul, here's a tip.
She really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot... until it starts to get red.
Shut up, Joey!
What are you up to tonight?
I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon...
So, nothing.
You're not even getting your honeymoon.
Although, Aruba.
This time of year?
Talk about your... big lizards.
If you don't want to be alone tonight...
Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.
We're very excited about it.
Thanks.
But I'm just going to hang out here.
-It's been a long day.
-Oh, sure.
Phoebe, wanna help?
I wish I could, but I don't want to.
Love is sweet as summer showers Love is a wondrous work of art But your love Oh, your love, your love Is like a giant pigeon Crapping on my heart I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things...
Using a bunch of these little worm guys.
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever...
And I cannot feel my legs.
-We got a bookcase.
-It's beautiful.
What's this?
I would have to say that is an L-shaped bracket.
-Which goes where?
-I have no idea.
-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.
This was Carol's favorite beer.
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.
-Start with that, we're out of here.
-Please don't spoil all this fun.
Let me ask you.
She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.
What did you get?
-You guys.
-You got screwed.
-Oh, my God.
-I know.
I'm such an idiot.
I should've known when she went to the dentist five times a week.
I mean, how clean can teeth get?
My brother's going through that.
How did you get over it?
He might accidentally break something valuable of hers.
-Say her...
-Leg?
That's one way of doing it.
I went for the watch.
You actually broke her watch?
The worst I ever did was shred my old boyfriend's favorite towel.
-Steer clear of you.
-That's right.
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.
It's about me.
And I just...
The machine cut me off again.
Anyway...
I know that some lucky girl is going to become Mrs.
Barry Finkel.
But it isn't me.
It's not me.
Not that I have any idea who "me" is right now, but you just...
I'm divorced.
-I'm only 26, and I'm divorced!
-Shut up!
That only took me an hour.
We haven't had a relationship that's lasted longer than a Mento.
You have had the love of a woman for four years.
Four years of closeness and sharing, after which she ripped your heart out.
That is why we don't do it!
I don't think that was my point!
Know what's scary?
What if there's only one woman for everybody?
I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?
Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.
One woman.
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream.
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.
Rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.
You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.
It's the best thing to happen to you!
You got married.
You were like, what, 8?
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!
-I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
-Then stay out of my freezer.
Ever since she walked out on me...
You wanna spell it out with noodles?
It's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.
So there's going to be a fifth date?
Isn't there?
Yeah, yeah.
I think there is.
What were you going to say?
Ever since she left me...
I haven't been able to perform... sexually.
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry.
Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.
How long?
-Two years.
-Wow.
I'm glad you smashed her watch.
So you still think you might want that fifth date?
Yeah, I do.
We are gathered here to join Joanie Louise Cunningham... and Charles.
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi...
in the bonds of holy matrimony.
See!
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.
"Grab a spoon."
Do you know how long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?
Do the words, "Billy, don't be a hero," mean anything to you?
Great story.
But I gotta go.
I got a date with Andrea.
Angela.
No, Andrea.
Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.
Right, thanks.
It's Julie.
I'm out of here.
Here's the thing.
Even if I could get it together enough... to ask a woman out...
Who am I going to ask?
Isn't this amazing?
I've never made coffee in my life.
-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.
If I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
I think it's, "If I can invade Poland, there's nothing I can't do."
If you feel like you have to make a Western omelet or something...
Although, actually I'm really not that hungry.
Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.
-Good morning.
-Morning.
-Morning, Paul.
-Hello, Paul.
-Hi.
Paul, is it?
-Thank you so much.
-Stop.
Last night was like all my birthdays, both graduations... plus the barn-raising scene in Witness.
That wasn't a real date.
What the hell do you do on a real date?
Shut up and put my table back.
I've got to get to work.
If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Yeah, we all have jobs.
That's how we buy stuff.
-Yeah, I'm an actor.
-Have I seen you in anything?
Mostly regional work.
Unless you saw the Wee One's production of Pinocchio... at the little theater in the park?
It was a job!
"Look, Geppetto.
I'm a real live boy."
-I will not take this abuse.
-You're right, I'm sorry.
Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy You should both know that he's a dead man.
Oh, Chandler!
How are you doing today?
Sleep okay?
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.
I see that.
You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
I know.
He's just so...
-Remember you and Tony Demarco?
-Oh, yeah.
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.
-Wow, are you in trouble!
-Big time!
Want a wedding dress?
Hardly used.
I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.
I'm going to get up, go to work, and not think about him all day.
Or else I'm going to get up and go to work.
-Wish me luck!
-What for?
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
-Hi, Monica.
-Franny, welcome back.
-How was Florida?
-You had sex, didn't you?
-How do you do that?
-I hate you.
I'm pushing my aunt through Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.
So, who?
You know Paul?
Paul, the wine guy?
Yeah, I know Paul.
You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul?
I take credit for Paul.
Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Of course it was a line.
Why would anybody do something like that?
I assume we want an answer more sophisticated than: "To get you into bed."
I hate men.
Don't hate.
You don't want to put that out into the universe.
Is it me?
Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs... and men with emotional problems can hear?
Give me your feet.
I just thought he was nice, you know?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.
-Guess what?
-You got a job?
Are you kidding?
I'm trained for nothing.
-I was laughed out of 12 interviews.
-You're surprisingly upbeat.
You'd be too, if you found these boots on sale... 50% off.
How well you know me.
They're my "I don't need a job...
I've got great boots" boots.
-How did you pay?
-Credit card.
And who pays for that?
My father.
Is this really necessary?
I can stop charging any time.
You can't live off your parents.
I know that.
That's why I was getting married.
Give her a break.
It's hard being on your own.
I remember when I first came to this city, I was 14.
Mom had killed herself, stepdad was in jail.
I didn't know anybody here.
I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields.
And then he killed himself.
Then I found aromatherapy.
So I know exactly how you feel.
The word you're looking for is: "Anyway..."
-You ready?
-No, how can I be ready?
"Ready to jump out of the plane with no parachute?"
-I can't do this.
-I know you can.
-No.
-You made coffee, you can do anything.
Cut.
I think we can leave it at that.
-Kind of a symbolic gesture.
-Rachel, that was a library card.
If you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Welcome to the real world!
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.
Are you going to crash on the couch?
-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?
Look what I just found on the floor.
That's Paul's watch.
Just put it back where you found it.
Oh, boy!
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.
-I'm sorry.
Have it, I don't want it.
-Split it?
You probably didn't know this, but in high school...
I had a major crush on you.
I knew.
You did?
I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.
I did.
Listen, do you think...?
Try not to let my vulnerability become a factor here.
Do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime?
Okay, maybe I will.
Wait, wait.
What's with you?
I just grabbed a spoon.
-I can't believe what I'm hearing.
-Can't believe what I'm hearing -What?
I said...
I said...
-Would you stop?
-Was I doing it again?
I said you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.
-You won't know a butt if it bit you.
-There's an image.
Would anybody like more coffee?
You made it, or you're serving it?
-I'm just serving it.
-I'll have a cup of coffee.
Kids, new dream.
I'm in Las Vegas.
Miss, more coffee?
Could you give this to that guy over there?
Go ahead.
Okay, Las Vegas.
I'm Liza Minnelli...
Oh, here's little Ben falling asleep.
A little bit later.
Is he gonna sleep?
Is he gonna?
Yep, out like a light!
This sure trumps the "Has he pooped?" series.
Ross, we love him, okay?
But right now he's just a little fat guy.
How excited can we get?
-What you got?
-400 pictures of Ben on a rug.
-Oh, my God!
-Let me see!
The One Where Rachel Finds Out Here's little Ben nodding off.
Look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
-Look, he's got Ross' haircut.
-Let me see.
Is he just the sweetest thing?
You must just wanna kiss him all over.
That would be nice.
-Pardon?
-Nothing.
Just a little extra air in my mouth.
Chan, can you help me out?
I'll pay you back.
Including the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
-Really, I'll pay you back this time.
-Where's this money coming from?
I'm helping out at the NYU Med School with research.
What kind of research?
Just, you know, science.
Science.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
It's a fertility study.
Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Actually, a little more than that.
Thank you, God.
This will bring us so much joy.
Come on, it's not that big a deal.
I just go down there every other day...
And make my contribution to the project.
But at the end of two weeks, I get $700!
You're gonna be making money hand over fist.
That's funny.
Very funny.
This is great.
I actually know somebody who loves what they do.
But what do you do to unwind after a tough day at work?
Okay, we got the coleslaw and buns.
The ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys.
I just love barbecuing with you.
Men are here!
We make fire.
Cook meat.
Put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Cute.
-Melanie called.
She'll be late.
-Okay.
How are things going?
Is she becoming your "special someone"?
She's pretty great.
What does she think of your little science project?
You think I'd tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Man's got a point.
The tough thing is, she really wants to have sex.
Crazy bitch.
I got a week left to go.
According to the rules...
I can't conduct personal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Joey, we always know what you mean.
How long did you think this barbecue would last?
-I'm going to China.
-Jeez, you say one thing, and...
-China?
-For the museum.
Someone found a bone.
They don't want us to have it.
I'm going to try to persuade them.
It's a whole big bone thing.
Anyway, I'll be gone for a week.
If you want to reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.
Could you show it to Ben every now and then so he doesn't forget me?
"Hi, Ben.
I'm your father."
"I am The Head!"
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.
I wanted to wish Rachel a happy birthday before I left.
-She's out having drinks with Carl.
-Hey, who's Carl?
That guy she met at the coffeehouse.
-There's this guy she met at...
-The coffeehouse?
So you do know who he is.
I'll go say goodbye to the guys.
Tell them that bone story.
-I have to go to China.
-The country?
No, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront.
Do you know who Carl is?
Let's see.
Alvin, Simon, Theodore...
Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
How can she, when she's never shown interest in you?
-Forget about her.
-He's right.
Please move on.
Go to China.
Eat Chinese food.
Of course, there they just call it "food."
Yeah, I guess.
All right, just give her this for me, okay?
We're looking out for you.
We want you to be happy.
I may only have a couple beers in me, but I love you.
I'm still on my first.
I just think you're nice.
That's when we started this fruit basket business.
We call ourselves "The Three Basketeers."
Like "The Three Musketeers," only with fruit.
-How do you want your burgers?
-Presents first!
We're doing presents first.
Hey, hold on there, tiger.
How are you holding up?
Well, not so good.
She thinks tonight we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what...
And you do.
Have you ever thought about being there for her?
What do you mean?
You know, just be there for her.
Not following you.
Think about it.
I'm guessing this is from...
-Thank you, Melanie.
-This one right here is from me.
It's light.
It rattles.
Travel Scrabble!
This one's from Joey.
It feels like a book, I think it's a book.
And it's a book!
It's Dr.
Seuss!
That book got me through some tough times.
There's a little child inside this man.
The doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
-Who's this from?
-From Ross.
Oh, my God!
He remembered!
-Remembered what?
-It was months ago.
We walked by this antique store.
I saw this pin.
I told him it was like one my grandma had when I was little.
I can't believe he remembered!
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
It's so pretty!
This must've cost him a fortune.
I can't believe it.
Remember when he fell in love with Carol... and bought her that expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
Crystal duck.
The "love" part?
-Oh, no, no, no.
That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.
That'll turn back time.
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!
This is really, really huge.
No, it's not.
It's small.
It's tiny.
It's petite.
It's wee.
I don't think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again.
Is there a mute button on this woman?
I think this is so great.
I mean, you and Ross!
-Did you have any idea?
-No, none!
My first night in the city, he mentioned asking me out...
But nothing ever happened.
What else did he say?
Does he wanna go out?
Given that he's in love with you...
He wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee.
Ross?
All this time?
I've gotta talk to him.
-He's in China!
-The country.
Is his flight gone?
He's watching a woman do this: He's gone!
His flight doesn't leave for 45 minutes.
-What about time difference?
-From here to the airport?
-You'll never make it!
-I've gotta try.
What'll you say to him?
-I don't know.
-Then you shouldn't go.
If you're gonna break his heart, that can wait.
But if it's good, tell him now.
-Maybe I'll know when I see him.
-All right, does this help?
Look, all I know is, I cannot wait a week.
This is just too big.
I've just gotta talk to him.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Rachel, I love you!
Deal with me first!
-Ross!
Excuse me, pardon me.
-Your boarding pass?
I need to talk to my friend.
Sorry, you're not allowed here without a pass.
He's right there, in the blue jacket!
Can I?
Federal regulations!
Then could you please just give him a message for me?
-This is very important.
-All right.
What's the message?
Excuse me, sir!
Excuse me, sir?
I have a message for you.
Rachel loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.
Toby, I don't know what she's talking about.
There's no Rachel.
Don't give me that deep freeze.
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!
I think I blacked out there for a minute.
It was nothing.
Well, now we gotta find something fun for you.
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.
-Me, again?
-Sure.
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow!
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like I thought you'd be.
How do you mean?
I had you pegged as a guy who's always, "Me, me, me!"
But you, you're a giver.
You're the most generous man I ever met.
I mean, you're practically a woman.
-You're just saying that.
A woman!
-So?
-I missed him.
-I'm so sorry.
-That's too bad.
Yeah, right.
No, I feel bad for her.
I can think of somebody other than myself.
All right, I'm going to bed.
-Happy birthday.
Hang in there.
Pizza coupons.
You guys want help cleaning up this mess?
That'd be great.
So, Rach, you wanna save this wrapping paper?
Are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I throw it out?
Thought about it all the way there...
And I thought about it all the way back.
You know, it's Ross!
You know what I mean?
It's Ross.
-Sure!
This is just my initial gut feeling...
But I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be like friends-in-law!
The best part is you already know all about him.
You start on the 15th date.
But it would be like starting on the 15th date.
Another good point.
I mean, on the 15th date, you're already in a very... relationship-y" place.
You're committed.
What happens if it doesn't work out?
-Why isn't it working out?
-Sometimes it doesn't.
Is he not cute enough?
Does he not make enough money?
-No, I'm just...
-Maybe there's someone else.
-Is there someone else?
-No, there is no one else.
Then why are you dumping my brother?
Hey, big...
Spender!
She's still asleep.
-So how'd it go?
-You know how you think you're great?
The fact you'd even ask shows how little you know me.
Last night I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great.
So I had to do all this other stuff.
And the response I got!
Man, oh, man!
It was like a ticker-tape parade!
My room's very, very close to the parade route.
It was amazing, and not just for her.
For me too!
It's like, all of a sudden I'm blind...
But all my other senses are heightened.
It's like I was able to appreciate it... on another level.
-I didn't know you had another level.
Neither did I!
Is something going on with O.J.?
Hey, great skirt.
Birthday present?
-From who?
-You.
I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Well, it's the thought.
Doesn't Ross' flight get in in a couple hours?
At gate 27B?
Monica, you know, I've been thinking about it.
I've decided this Ross thing is not a good idea.
I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him.
I'd be going out with all of you.
There'd be pressure...
No pressure, no pressure!
Nothing has happened, and you're already so...
I'm not "so."
Okay, I was a teensy bit weird at first... but I'll be good.
-Who is it?
-It's me, Carl.
-Come on up.
-Behind my brother's back?
Is the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
-Seven hundred bucks!
-All right, you did it!
Do we have any fruit?
Man, hell of a two weeks.
I feel I learned something.
You'll stick with this "all for her" thing?
What are you, crazy?
When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
If I see one more picture of Ed Begley Jr... in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself!
I'm not against environmental issues, per se...
It's just that guy!
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Excuse me, I'm trying to have a date here.
Just stop thinking about me.
Can't do it, can you?
I'm thinking about you.
I don't get it.
What do you see in this guy?
Happens to be a very nice guy.
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!
Rachel, come on.
Give us a chance.
Ross, it's too hard.
Why, because it'll get weird for everyone else?
This is about us.
I've been in love with you since the ninth grade.
You're like my best friend.
If we broke up, and I lost you...
What makes you think that?
Have you been involved where you haven't broken up?
But it only has to happen once.
You and I both know we are perfect for each other.
Right?
So the only question is: Are you attracted to me?
I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Well, start looking.
-Exactly!
And I'm gonna be the guy... caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
Right!
You're right.
I'm supposed to pick up a friend at the airport.
I am so sorry!
If you wanna finish your drinks, please do.
-I'm sorry, I gotta go.
-But...
-Where are you going?
-To get Ross.
-My God, this is so exciting!
If you want the rest of my date, I'm not gonna finish it.
-Rachel, he's not a sandwich.
-No, he's a banker with opera tickets.
Hello!
-Where you going?
-Airport.
You can't tell him.
There's so much I haven't done.
I haven't watched Baywatch with Yasmine Bleeth!
Chandler, relax.
This is a good going to the airport.
Oh, well then fly, good woman, fly like the wind.
-I'm flying!
-Tell him I'm the one who blew it!
Yes, another successful case for the love doctor.
Excuse me!
Pardon me.
Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go?
There's no Rachel!
I got that.
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.
I can't wait for you to meet my friends.
You don't think they'll judge me?
-No, they will.
I just...
-Can't wait!
Come on, they're gonna love you.
I'm in high school, in the cafeteria..
and I realize I'm totally naked.
Then I look down and I realize there is a phone..
there.
- Instead of - That's right!
I feel like someone pulled my intestine out of my mouth..
- and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Just leave my aura alone, okay?
- Fine, be murky.
- I'll be fine.
- No, you don't.
So that hysterical phone call from a woman sobbing..
"I'll never have grandchildren," was what?
- Rachel?
- Oh, Monica!
I went to your building..
and a guy with a hammer said you'd be here, and you are.
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Decaf.
Chandler and Phoebe..
Joey.
I was in the room with all the presents..
and I was looking at this really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
When all of a sudden I always knew he looked familiar, but..
I had to get out of there, and I started wondering..
"Why am I doing this," and "Who am I doing it for?"
I didn't know where to go, and I know we've drifted apart..
but you're the only person I know here.
- Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
- I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.
Daddy, I just I can't marry him.
It's Paul.
- Who's Paul?
- Paul, the wine guy?
- He finally asked you out?
- Rach, I can cancel.
- Please, go, I'll be fine.
- Really?- Go on!
Paul, this is..
everybody.
- The wine guy.
- I didn't catch your name.
I've just gotta go She really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot..
until it starts to get red.
I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon..
so, nothing.
Talk about your..
big lizards.
If you don't want to be alone tonight..
Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.
- It's been a long day.
- Oh, sure.
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things..
using a bunch of these little worm guys.
I see no worm guys whatsoever..
and I cannot feel my legs.
- We got a bookcase.
- It's beautiful.
- Which goes where?
- Done with the bookcase.
- All finished.
- Start with that, we're out of here.
- Please don't spoil all this fun.
- You guys.
- You got screwed.
- Oh, my God.
- I know.
- Say her - Leg?
- Steer clear of you.
- That's right.
And I just...
Anyway..
I know that some lucky girl is going to become Mrs.
Not that I have any idea who "me" is right now, but you just...
- I'm only 26, and I'm divorced!
- Shut up!
- I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
- Then stay out of my freezer.
Ever since she walked out on me..
Ever since she left me..
I haven't been able to perform..
sexually.
- Two years.
- Wow.
We are gathered here to join Joanie Louise Cunningham..
and Charles.
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi..
in the bonds of holy matrimony.
Even if I could get it together enough..
to ask a woman out..
who am I going to ask?
- That is amazing.
- Congratulations.
If you feel like you have to make a Western omelet or something..
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Morning, Paul.
- Hello, Paul.
- Thank you so much.
Last night was like all my birthdays, both graduations..
plus the barn-raising scene in Witness.
- Yeah, I'm an actor.
- Have I seen you in anything?
Unless you saw the Wee One's production of Pinocchio..
at the little theater in the park?
- I will not take this abuse.
- You're right, I'm sorry.
He's just so..
- Remember you and Tony Demarco?
- Oh, yeah.
- Wow, are you in trouble!
- Big time!
- Wish me luck!
- What for?
- Hi, Monica.
- Franny, welcome back.
- How was Florida?
- You had sex, didn't you?
- How do you do that?
- I hate you.
Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs..
and men with emotional problems can hear?
- Guess what?
- You got a job?
- I was laughed out of 12 interviews.
- You're surprisingly upbeat.
You'd be too, if you found these boots on sale..
50% off.
They're my "I don't need a job..
I've got great boots" boots.
- How did you pay?
- Credit card.
"Anyway.."
- You ready?
- No, how can I be ready?
- I can't do this.
- I know you can.
- You made coffee, you can do anything.
- Kind of a symbolic gesture.
- Rachel, that was a library card.
- No, I gotta go home sometime.
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.
- I'm sorry.
- Split it?
You probably didn't know this, but in high school..
I had a major crush on you.
Listen, do you think..?
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- Can't believe what I'm hearing.
I said.
- What?
I said.
- Would you stop?
- Was I doing it again?
- You won't know a butt if it bit you.
- There's an image.
- I'm just serving it.
- I'll have a cup of coffee.
I'm Liza Minnelli..
You're going out with a guy.
There's gotta be something wrong with him.
All right, Joey, be nice.
So does he have a hump and a hair piece?
Does he eat chalk?
Relax.
I'm in high school, in the middle of the cafeteria...
- Instead of...
- That's right!
That one, I've never had.
I don't know what to do.
Everybody's looking at me.
This guy says, "Hello", I wanna kill myself.
You okay, sweetie?
I feel like someone grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...
And tied it around my neck.
Carol moved out today.
Just leave my aura alone, okay?
Be murky.
I hope she'll be very happy.
And you never knew she was a lesbian.
They seemed to take it well.
Really?
So that hysterical call I got from a woman sobbing at 3 a.m.
"I'll never have grandchildren!"
Was, what?
Come on, you're single.
See, but I don't want to be single, okay?
Rachel?
Oh, God, Monica!
Hi!
I went to your building and this guy with a hammer said...
That you might be here and you are.
Everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.
And remember my brother, Ross?
I was in this room with all the presents...
And I was looking at this gravy boat.
This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
When all of a sudden I realize...
I realized...
I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry.
And then I really freaked out, when it hit me...
"Why am I doing this?" and "Who am I doing this for?"
I didn't know where to go, and I know you and I have drifted apart...
But you're the only person I know in the city.
Who wasn't asked to the wedding.
I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.
I guess he bought her the pipe organ...
And she's really not happy about it.
"Tuna or egg salad?"
"Decide!"
"I'll have whatever Christine is having."
I say push her down the stairs!
"You're a shoe!
You're a shoe!
You're a shoe!"
I stopped and said, "What if I don't wanna be a shoe?"
"What if I want to be a purse?"
"Or a hat?"
I don't want you to buy me a hat, I...
Well, maybe I don't need your money.
Breathe, that's it.
Just try to think of nice, calm things.
Raindrops on roses.
And whiskers on kittens.
Doorbells and sleigh bells.
- These are a...
- I'm all better now.
This is probably for the best, you know?
Taking control of your life.
The whole "hat" thing.
If you need anything, you can always come to Joey.
And he's away a lot.
Joey, stop hitting on her!
Like there's a rule or something?
It's Paul.
Is it 6:30?
Your "not a real date", is with Paul, the wine guy?
He finally asked you out?
Rach, I can cancel.
Please, no.
Go, I'll be fine.
Ross are you okay?
- Go on!
Does he sell it, drink it, or he just complains a lot?
I've just got to go a...
Hey, Paul.
Here's a little tip.
She likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot...
Over and over again, till it starts to get a little red.
Rachel, what are you up to tonight?
If you don't feel like being alone tonight...
And we're very excited about it.
But I'm just gonna hang out here.
Sure.
Pheebs, wanna help?
Love is sweet as summer showers.
Love is a wondrous work of art.
But your love, oh, your love.
Your love is like a giant pigeon crapping on my heart.
Thank you!
We got a bookcase here.
It's a beautiful thing.
If you start with that, we're out of here.
Please don't spoil all this fun.
Let me ask you a question.
You guys.
I should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week.
He's a mess.
How did you get through it?
He might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers.
- Say her...
- Leg?
That's one way of going through it.
Me, I went for the watch.
The worst thing I ever did was...
I shredded my old boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
- Steer clear of you!
Machine cut me off again.
I know that some girl is going to be lucky to become Mr.
Not that I have any idea who "me" is right now, but give me a chance to...
I'm divorced!
I'm only 26 and I'm divorced.
Between us, we haven't had a relationship last longer than a Mento.
You, however, have had the love of a woman for four years.
Four years of closeness and sharing.
After which, she ripped your heart out...
And that is why we don't do it.
I don't think that was my point.
You know what's scary?
What if there is only one woman for everybody?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.
Rocky road, and cookie dough, and bing cherry vanilla.
You can get them with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream.
This is the best thing that ever happened to you!
You were like, what?
Eight?
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Then stay out of my freezer.
Ever since she walked out on me, I...
Two years.
We are gathered here to join together...
Joanie Louise Cunningham...
and Charles Chachi, Chachi, Chachi...
- Marriage is the most sacred...
- See!
Do you know long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?
Do the words, "Billy, don't be a hero", mean anything to you?
Andrea.
Oh, man.
You know, here's the thing.
I have never made coffee before in my life.
I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
I think it's, "If I can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do."
If you feel like you gotta make a Western omelet or something...
- Stop!
Last night was like... all my birthdays, graduations, plus the barn-raising scene in "Witness".
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Have I seen you in anything?
Unless you happen to catch the Wee One's production of "Pinocchio"... at the Little Theater in the Park.
It was a job, all right?
"Look, Geppeto.
I will not take this abuse.
Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy You should both know that he's a dead man.
You sleep okay?
Remember you and Tony De Marco?
- Are you in trouble!
We're getting a little ahead of ourselves here.
Or else I'm just going to get up and go to work.
- Hey, Monica.
- Hey, Franny.
Welcome back.
How was Florida?
You had sex, didn't you?
How do you do that?
I hate you.
I'm pushing my aunt through Parrot Jungle... and you're having sex.
We're looking for an answer more sophisticated than...
"To get you into bed."
I hate men!
Don't put that out in the universe.
Guess what?
- Are you kidding?
I was laughed out of 12 interviews.
You're surprisingly upbeat.
You would be too if you found Joan and David boots on sale...
50% percent off.
They're my, "I don't need a job or my parents.
I've got great boots", boots.
- How did you pay for them?
Come on, is this necessary?
I can stop charging any time I want.
It's hard being on your own for the first time.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
When I first came to this city, I was 14.
My mom had killed herself and my stepdad was in prison.
And I got here, and I didn't know anybody.
Believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
You ready?
No, I'm not ready.
How can I be ready?
"You ready to jump out of the plane without a chute?"
I can't do this.
- I don't think so.
You made coffee.
You can do anything.
Cut, cut, cut.
We can just leave it at that.
Like a symbolic gesture.
That was a library card.
If you listen very closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
You gonna crash on the couch?
You can just put it back where you found it.
- No, have it, really.
You probably didn't know this, but back in high school I had... a major crush on you.
I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Listen, do you think...
And try not to let my vulnerability become any kind of a factor here.
Do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime, maybe?
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
I said you had...
- What?
Would you stop?
Was I doing it again?
I said that you had a nice butt.
You wouldn't know a great butt if it bit you.
There's an image.
Did you make it?
Excuse me?
So I'm in Las Vegas.
I'm Liza Minnelli.
You need to drink, child.
And eat.
Isn't there anything else?
The Dothraki have two things in abundance: grass and horses.
People can't live on grass.
In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night.
It murders all other grass.
The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything-- that's the way the world will end.
It'll get easier.
Khaleesi!
Your hands.
We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace.
Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality.
You'd be more comfortable there.
I have no interest in hospitality or comfort.
I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
As you wish, your Grace.
Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading.
What did Ned Stark want you for?
Buying from a slaver?
Selling to one-- some poachers I caught on my land.
Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense.
You can rest assured of that.
Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle.
My mother's been looking for you.
We ride for King's Landing today.
Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.
What good will my sympathies do them?
None.
But it is expected of you.
Your absence has already been noted.
The boy means nothing to me.
And I can't stand the wailing of women.
One word and I'll hit you again.
I'm telling mother!
Tell her.
But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?
You can't-- The prince will remember that, little lord.
If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him.
Ah.
Time for breakfast.
Bread.
And two of those little fish.
And a mug of dark beer to wash it down.
And bacon, burned black.
Hyah.
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.
Is Bran going to die?
Apparently not.
- What do you mean?
- The Maester says the boy may live.
It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.
Only the gods know for certain.
All the rest of us can do is pray.
The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
I still can't believe you're going.
It's ridiculous even for you.
Where's your sense of wonder?
The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of The Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.
Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock.
No, I just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off the edge of the world.
The children don't need to hear your filth.
Come.
Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.
Give me a good clean death any day.
Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree.
Death is so final, whereas life...
Ah, life is full of possibilities.
I hope the boy does wake.
I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.
My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.
My dear brother, you wound me.
You know how much I love my family.
Oh, I would have dressed, your Grace.
This is your home.
I'm your guest.
Handsome one, isn't he?
I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty.
He was a fighter too-- tried to beat the fever that took him.
Forgive me.
It's the last thing you need to hear right now.
I never knew.
It was years ago.
Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care.
The boy looked just like him.
Such a little thing...
A bird without feathers.
They came to take his body away and Robert held me.
I screamed and I battled, but he held me.
That little bundle.
They took him away and I never saw him again.
Never have visited the crypt, never.
I pray to the mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.
I am grateful.
Perhaps this time she'll listen.
A sword for the wall?
- I already have one.
- Good man.
- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course I have.
At someone, I mean.
It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man.
You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing.
Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the wall--
Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot.
We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.
We've guarded the kingdoms for 8,000 years.
Is it "we" already?
Have you taken your vows then?
Soon enough.
Give my regards to The Night's Watch.
I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force.
And if not?
It's only for life.
Thank you, Nymeria.
Septa Mordane says I have to do it again.
My things weren't properly folded, she says.
Who cares how they're folded?!
They're going to get all messed up anyway.
It's good you've got help.
Watch.
Nymeria, gloves.
- Impressive.
- Shut up.
Nymeria, gloves!
I have something for you.
And it has to be packed very carefully.
A present?
Close the door.
This is no toy.
Be careful you don't cut yourself.
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.
I had the blacksmith make it for you special.
It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.
I can be quick.
You'll have to work at it every day.
How does it feel?
Do you like the balance?
I think so.
First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.
I know which end to use.
I'm going to miss you.
Careful.
All the best swords have names, you know.
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.
I've got a needle of my own.
I came to say goodbye to Bran.
You've said it.
I wish I could be here when you wake up.
I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.
I'm taking the black.
I know we always talked about seeing the wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better.
I'll know my way around by then.
I'll be a sworn brother of The Night's Watch.
We can go out walking beyond the wall, if you're not afraid.
I want you to leave.
17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon.
You came back a year later with another woman's son.
And now you're leaving again.
I have no choice.
That's what men always say when honor calls.
That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves.
You do have a choice.
And you've made it.
Cat--
I can't do it, Ned.
- I really can't.
- You can.
You must.
You've said goodbye to Bran?
He's not going to die.
I know it.
You Starks are hard to kill.
My mother?
- She was very kind.
Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.
It was always my color.
- Farewell, Snow.
- And you, Stark.
There's great honor serving in The Night's Watch.
The Starks have manned the wall for thousands of years.
And you are a Stark.
You might not have my name, but you have my blood.
Is my mother alive?
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?
Does she care?
The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother.
Gods, this is country!
I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.
I've half a mind to go with you.
What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.
You should have asked me 20 years ago.
There were wars to fight, women to marry-- we never had the chance to be young.
I recall a few chances.
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?
That common girl of yours?
Becca?
With the great big tits you could bury your face in.
Bessie.
She was one of yours.
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits.
Yours was...
Aleena?
You told me once.
Meryl?
Your bastard's mother?
- Wylla.
- That's it.
She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor.
You never told me what she looked like.
Nor will I.
We were at war.
None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again.
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.
I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.
The worst thing about your coronation--
I'll never get to hit you again.
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.
There was a rider in the night.
Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord.
What of it?
Should we send her a wedding gift?
A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.
She's little more than a child.
Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?
What her father did to your family-- that was unspeakable.
What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister-- the woman I loved.
I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.
But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?
This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.
Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea.
They have no ships, Robert.
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.
If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.
And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.
There's a war coming, Ned.
I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.
Sit.
You'll be fed.
Untie them.
Ah, rapers.
They were given a choice no doubt-- castration or the wall.
Most choose the knife.
Not impressed by your new brothers?
Lovely thing about the watch-- you discard your old family and get a whole new one.
Why do you read so much?
Look at me and tell me what you see.
Is this a trick?
What you see is a dwarf.
If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die.
Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
Things are expected of me.
My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.
Until your brother killed that King.
Yes, until my brother killed him.
Life is full of these little ironies.
My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him.
I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree?
But how?
Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind.
And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.
That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.
And you?
What's your story, bastard?
Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of The Night's Watch, alongside his Valiant brothers-in-arms.
The Night's Watch protects the realm from--
Ah, yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about.
You're a smart boy.
You don't believe that nonsense.
Everything's better with some wine in the belly.
It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady.
You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.
Talk to Poole about it.
Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady.
We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require - our immediate attention--
- I don't care about appointments!
I'll make the appointments.
We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
Very good, my Lord.
My Lady.
When was the last time you left this room?
I have to take care of him.
He's not going to die, mother.
Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.
What if he's wrong?
- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.
He's six.
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying--
- close the windows!
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!
Fire.
You stay here.
I'll come back.
You're not supposed to be here.
No one is supposed to be here.
It's a mercy.
He's dead already.
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
Everywhere?
Even in the east?
No dragon.
Brave men kill them.
- It is known.
- It is known.
A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
The moon?
He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky.
But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat.
Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.
Moon is no egg.
Moon is goddess-- wife of sun.
- It is known.
Leave me with her.
Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
Men like to talk when they're happy.
Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.
- How old were you?
- I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
Nine?!
I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi.
First you must learn.
Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
- Yes.
- Will it take three years?
Welcome.
What I am about to tell you must remain between us.
I don't think Bran fell from that tower.
I think he was thrown.
The boy was always sure-footed before.
Someone tried to kill him twice.
Why?
Why murder an innocent child?
Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
- Saw what, my lady?
But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved.
We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
Did you notice the dagger the killer used?
It's too fine a weapon for such a man.
The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone.
Someone gave it to him.
They come into our home and try to murder my brother?
If it's war they want--
If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.
What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood?
Huh?
Too easily words of war become acts of war.
We don't know the truth yet.
Lord Stark must be told of this.
I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.
I must.
I'll send hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.
I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
Let me accompany you at least.
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
What about Bran?
I have prayed to the seven for more than a month.
Bran's life is in their hands now.
No, Khaleesi.
You must look in his eyes always.
Love comes in at the eyes.
It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.
Finish a man?
Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia.
Magisters sold their palaces.
Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours.
They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
Well, she sounds like an interesting woman.
I-- I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.
Men want what they've never had.
And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch.
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?
Then don't make love like a slave.
Very good, Khaleesi.
Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.
that this is the Dothraki way.
If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
Ajjalan anha zalat vitiherat yer hatif.
Pardon me, Ser.
Do I frighten you so much, girl?
Or is it him there making you shake?
He frightens me too.
Look at that face.
I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser.
Why won't he speak to me?
He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years.
Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
He speaks damn well with his sword though.
Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice.
The royal executioner.
What is it, sweet lady?
Does the hound frighten you?
Away with you, dog.
You're scaring my lady.
I don't like to see you upset.
The Sun is finally shining.
Come walk with me.
Stay, lady.
I probably shouldn't have any more.
Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.
My princess can drink as much as she wants.
Don't worry-- you're safe with me.
I'll get you!
- Arya!
- Ow!
- Go away.
- Your sister?
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my Lord.
- He the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.
A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh?
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.
She asked me to, my Lord.
She asked me to.
I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.
And you're not a Knight.
Only a butcher's boy.
That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.
I won't hurt him...
Much.
Filthy little bitch!
No no, stop it, stop it, both of you.
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!
I'll gut you, you little cunt!
- Nymeria!
Arya, leave him alone.
My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you.
Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.
Then go!
Don't touch me.
The wolf's not here.
Look down by the stream.
You've got to go.
They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey.
Go on-- run.
Leave now!
- It's a direwolf.
- I'll check down here.
I think I heard a noise.
Go!
Arya!
- Distant man: Arya!
- Ned: Arya!
Arya-aa!
My lord!
They found her.
She's unharmed.
Where is she?
She's been taken directly before the King.
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.
- Arya-aa!
- Right, get back.
The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
Back!
Back to the inn.
All back!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Are you hurt?
- No.
Oh, it's all right.
What is the meaning of this?
Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
Quiet, woman.
Sorry, Ned.
I never meant to frighten the girl.
But we need to get this business done quickly.
Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son.
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
That's not true!
She just...
Bit him a little.
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.
You and that boy beat him with clubs - while you set your wolf on him.
- That's not what happened!
Yes it is!
They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
- Liar!
Enough!
He tells me one thing, she tells me another.
Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?
Where's your other daughter, Ned?
In bed asleep.
She's not.
Sansa, come here, darling.
Now, child...
Tell me what happened.
Tell it all and tell it true.
It's a great crime to lie to a King.
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.
- I didn't see.
- Liar liar liar!
- Hey, stop it!
That's enough of that.
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.
I want her punished.
What would you have me do, whip her through the streets?
Damn it, children fight.
It's over.
Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
You let that little girl disarm you?
Ned, see to it that your daughter is disciplined.
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, your Grace.
And what of the direwolf?
What of the beast that savaged your son?
I'd forgot the damned wolf.
We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.
No?
So be it.
We have another wolf.
As you will.
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?
No no, not lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!
- You leave her alone!
- Stop them.
Don't let them do it.
Please please, it wasn't Lady!
Is this your command-- your Grace?
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, your Grace.
Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.
Jory...
Take the girls to their rooms.
If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.
Is this some trick?
The wolf is of the north.
She deserves better than a butcher.
The butcher's boy-- you rode him down?
He ran...
Not very fast.
Jorah: In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, Hyah.
Robb: I'll make the appointments.
- He's six.
Catelyn: What I am about to tell you must remain between us.
- I'll get you!
Man: The wolf's not here.
- Man: I think I heard a noise.
- Ned: Arya!
Robert: Enough!
Cersei: And what of the direwolf?
- If it must be done, There was a raven from King's Landing.
Jon Arryn is dead.
The King rides for Winterfell with the Queen and all the rest of them.
The Queen has two brothers?
There's the pretty one, and there's the clever one.
I have a son, you have a daughter.
We'll join our houses.
The boy I beheaded-- he was talking madness.
Said the others slaughtered his friends.
- Ned: A Wildling ambush.
- Maybe.
You're Tyrion Lannister.
You-- you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?
Never forget what you are and it can never be used to hurt you.
Now there are five, one for each of the Stark children.
- What about you?
- I'm not a Stark.
That one's yours, Snow.
May I present Viserys of House Targaryen, the rightful King of the Andals, and his sister Daenerys?
I don't want to be his queen.
We go home with an army-- with Khal Drogo's army.
From your sister.
She says Jon Arryn was murdered by the Lannisters.
What if Jon Arryn told someone?
Whatever Jon Arryn knew died with him.
Ros: The Queen has two brothers?
- Theon: That one's yours, Snow.
Viserys: We go home with an army-- with Khal Drogo's army.
- The things I do for love.
Welcome, Lord Stark.
Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council.
The honor of your presence is requested.
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my Lord.
If you'd like to change into something more appropriate...
Thank the gods you're here, Stark.
About time we had some stern, northern leadership.
About glad to see you're protecting the throne.
Sturdy old thing.
How many Kings' asses have polished it, I wonder?
Um, what's the line?
The King shits and The Hand wipes.
Very handsome armor.
- Not a scratch on it.
People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.
You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
I have a knack for it.
It must be strange for you coming into this room.
I was standing right here when it happened.
He was very brave, your brother.
Your father too.
They didn't deserve to die like that.
Nobody deserves to die like that.
But you just stood there and watched.
500 men just stood there and watched.
All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms-- you think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?
No, Lord Stark.
500 men and this room was silent as a crypt.
Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing.
And later...
when I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned...
It felt like justice.
Is that what you tell yourself at night?
You're a servant of justice?
That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
Tell me-- if I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?
You served him well when serving was safe.
Lord Stark.
Lord Varys.
I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad.
We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son.
Renly!
You're looking well.
And you look tired from the road.
I told them this meeting could wait another day, but--
But we have a Kingdom to look after.
I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark.
No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
She has, Lord Baelish.
I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord.
It was Catelyn Tully.
A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.
I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.
Grand Maester.
How many years has it been?
- You were a young man.
- And you served another King.
Oh, how forgetful of me.
This belongs to you, now.
Should we begin?
- Without the King?
- Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.
His Grace has many cares.
He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
We are the Lords of Small Matters here.
My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
Mmm, how much?
40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.
Can the treasury bear such expense?
I'll have to borrow it.
The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect.
We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.
What's another 80,000?
Are you telling me the crown is three million in debt?
I'm telling you the crown is six million in debt.
How could you let this happen?
The Master of Coin finds the money.
The King and The Hand spend it.
I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear his Grace - doesn't always listen.
- "Counting coppers," he calls it.
I'll speak to him tomorrow.
This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
But still, we'd best make our plans.
There will be no plans until I speak to Robert.
Forgive me, my Lords.
I'm--
- I had a long ride.
- You are The King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.
- Please, it's nearly healed.
- It's ugly.
- A King should have scars you fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.
I'm not like him.
I didn't fight off anything.
It bit me and all I did was scream.
And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.
That's not true.
You killed the beast.
You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father.
I didn't, I--
When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor.
Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.
Do I have to marry her?
She's very beautiful and young.
If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses.
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores.
And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it.
You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be.
Do something nice for the Stark girl.
- No, but you will.
The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.
We allow the Northerners too much power.
They consider themselves our equals.
How would you handle them?
I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the Royal Army.
A Royal Army?
Why should every lord command his own men?
It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes.
We should have a standing army of men loyal to the crown, trained by experienced soldiers-- instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.
And if the Northerners rebel?
I'd crush them.
Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as warden of the North.
Uncle Kevan, maybe.
And these 10,000 Northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?
- For me.
I'm their King.
- Mm-hmm.
But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.
The North cannot be held-- not by an outsider.
It's too big and too wild.
And when the winter comes, the Seven Gods together couldn't save you and your royal army.
A good King knows when to save his strength...
And when to destroy his enemies.
So you agree...
The Starks are enemies?
Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.
- I'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?
- The Prince.
- Arya, stop!
He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
The Hound killed your friend.
The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
You're an idiot.
You're a liar, and if you told the truth - Mycah would be alive.
- Enough!
What's happening here?
Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
Go to your room.
We'll speak later.
That's for you, love.
The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.
Don't you like it?
I haven't played with dolls since I was eight.
- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.
It's all right.
War was easier than daughters.
Go away!
Arya, open the door.
May I come in?
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.
Give it to me.
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.
Where did you get this?
Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
I wasn't playing.
And I don't want to be a lady.
Now what do you want with this?
It's called Needle.
Oh, a blade with a name.
And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle?
Your sister?
Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
Stick 'em with the pointy end.
That's the essence of it.
I was trying to learn.
I asked Mycah to practice with me.
I asked him.
- It was my fault.
- No, sweet girl.
No no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.
I hate them!
I hate all of them.
The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.
Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen...
And asked to call the Prince a liar.
So was I!
He is a liar.
Shh, darling, listen to me.
Sansa will be married to Joffrey's someday.
She cannot betray him.
She must take his side even when he's wrong.
But how you can let her marry someone like that?
Well.
Look me.
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.
You were born in the long summer.
You've never known anything else.
But now winter is truly coming.
And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another.
Sansa is your sister.
I don't hate her.
Not really.
I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either.
We've come to a dangerous place.
We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.
It's yours.
I can keep it?
Try not to stab your sister with it.
If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.
Don't listen to it.
Crows are all liars.
- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.
I know a story about a boy who hated stories.
I could tell you about Ser Duncan the tall.
Those were always your favorites.
Those weren't my favorites.
My favorites were the scary ones.
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?
Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.
Fear is for the long night, when the Sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness.
That is the time for fear, my little lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods.
Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation.
Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the Shepherds in their huts.
And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks.
So is this the sort of story that you like?
In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time.
They swept through cities and Kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as Hounds--
Only what what the little lord telling wants to hear.
Get your supper.
I want some time with him.
One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.
Maybe we do.
How do you feel?
You still don't remember anything?
Bran, I've seen you climb a thousand times.
In the wind, in the rain-- a thousand times.
- You never fall.
- I did though.
It's true, isn't it, what Maester Luwin says about my legs?
I'd rather be dead.
- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.
Fewer eyes back here, my Lady.
But still too many.
It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital.
And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?
I would.
We've done nothing wrong.
We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
Instructed?
I don't know who's providing your instructions, but-- follow me, Lady Stark.
Cat!
Go upstairs.
You little worm!
You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a--
Pssst!
I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
How dare you bring me here!
Have you lost your mind?
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I'm truly sorry about the locale.
How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
A dear friend told me.
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.
To see you again after so many years is a blessing.
Your poor hands.
How did you know I was coming?
Knowledge is my trade, my Lady.
Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance?
My little birds are everywhere...
Even in the North.
They whisper to me the strangest stories.
Valyrian steel.
Do you know whose dagger this is?
I must admit I do not.
Well well, this is an historic day.
Something you don't know that I do.
There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms.
- It's mine.
- Yours?
At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last Nameday.
I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would.
When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.
To whom?
Tyrion Lannister.
The imp.
Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of.
If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you.
Pyp.
Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?
Next!
Next!
Well, Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here.
Go clean yourselves up.
There's only so much I can stomach in a day.
A charming man.
I don't need him to be charming.
I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of The Night's Watch.
And how's that going, commander Mormont?
Slowly.
A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
Good news or bad?
Both.
Maester Pycelle: Lord Stark.
I meant to give you this earlier.
So forgetful these days.
A raven from Winterfell this morning.
Good news?
Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?
Yes, I'm looking at you.
I thought that she'd be safest in here.
One of several such establishments I own.
You're a funny man.
A very funny man.
Ned!
Ah, the Starks-- quick tempers, slow minds.
You broke my nose, bastard!
It's an improvement.
If we threw you over The Wall, I wonder how long it would take you to hit.
I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
What're you looking at, half man?
I'm looking at you.
Yes.
You've got an interesting face.
Hmm, very distinctive faces.
All of you.
And what do you care about our faces?
It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing.
Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.
Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me.
No one but you.
My father knew and he left me to rot at The Wall all the same.
Grenn's father left him too...
Outside a farmhouse when he was three.
Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese.
His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.
He was given a choice: His right hand or The Wall.
I've been asking the lord commander about them.
Fascinating stories.
They hate me because I'm better than they are.
It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a Master-at-Arms like your Ser Rodrik.
I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here.
Oh...
Your brother Bran.
He's woken up.
The mere suggestion that the queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
We have proof.
We have the blade.
Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him.
The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.
Petyr has promised to help us find the truth.
He's like a little brother to me, Ned.
He would never betray my trust.
I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake.
A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.
I won't forget this.
You're a true friend.
Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.
He's a child-- 10 years old.
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.
You're a bit late to start complaining about it now.
- What has the boy told them?
He's said nothing.
He remembers nothing.
Then what are you raving about?
What if it comes back to him?
If he tells his father what he saw--
we'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.
We'll say whatever we like.
I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.
They can write a ballad about us: "The War for Cersei's Cunt."
- Let me go.
- Never.
- The boy won't talk.
And if he does, I'll kill him.
Him, Ned Stark, the king- the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.
I wish I could see the girls.
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.
Until we know who our enemies are--
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.
In my bones, I know it.
Littlefinger's right.
I can't do anything without proof.
And if you find the proof?
Then I bring it to Robert...
And hope he's still the man I once knew.
You watch yourself on the road, huh?
That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.
My temper?
Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.
He still loves you.
Does he?
Off with you.
Yes, it's been a long time.
But I still remember every face.
You remember your first?
Of course, Your Grace.
Who was it?
A Tyroshi.
- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.
How'd you do it?
Lance through the heart.
Quick one.
Lucky for you.
Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall.
My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud.
He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with single swing of his sword.
I knocked him down with the hammer.
Gods, I was strong then.
Caved in his breastplate.
Probably shattered every rib he had.
Stood over him, hammer in the air.
Right before I brought it down he shouted, "wait!
Wait."
They never tell you how they all shit themselves.
They don't put that part in the songs.
Stupid boy.
Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else.
He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl.
Wine!
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.
Lancel Lannister.
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean it's empty?
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?
So get more.
Tell your cousin to get in here.
Kingslayer!
Get in here.
Surrounded by Lannisters.
Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces.
It must wound your pride, huh?
Standing out there like a glorified sentry.
Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin...
Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks.
So come on.
We're telling war stories.
Who was your first kill, not counting old men?
One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
I was there that day.
You were only a squire, 16 years old.
You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte.
Best move I ever saw.
A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.
Your outlaw...
Any last words?
- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmmm.
What about Aerys Targaryen?
What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back?
I never asked.
Did he call you a traitor?
Did he plead for a reprieve?
He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours...
"Burn them all."
If that's all, Your Grace...
Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?
The Dothraki don't believe in money.
Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
- From whom?
- If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices: pay tribute or fight.
An easy choice for most.
Of course, sometimes it's not enough.
Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given.
He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly.
Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months - and need the practice.
- Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
Tell them all to stop.
You want the entire horde to stop?
For how long?
Until I command them otherwise.
You're learning to talk like a Queen.
Not a Queen.
A Khaleesi.
Annakhas dozgosores.
You dare!
You give commands to me?
To me?
You do not command the Dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
I don't take orders from savages or their sluts.
Hash shafka zali nharees, zhey Khaleesi?
Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.
Ishish chare acharoe hash me nem éjervae - nharesoon.
- Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.
- Please please, don't hurt him.
Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.
Khaleesi vos zalo meme nem azisa.
Shafki.
Mormont!
Kill these Dothraki dogs!
I am your King!
Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?
Uh uh uh uh uh.
You walk.
I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time.
- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?
I'm the First Ranger.
My job is out there.
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?
The kind I don't want to believe.
I'm ready.
I won't let you down.
You're not going.
You're no Ranger, Jon.
- But I'm better than every--
- Better than no one!
Here...
A man gets what he earns, when he earns it.
We'll speak when I return.
- A bear's balls.
- Tyrion: Oh, you're joking?
And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat.
When you're a hundred miles North of The Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.
And how do a bear's balls taste?
A bit chewy.
And what about you, my Lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?
Do Dornish girls count?
So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?
But it's not all of 'em's done bad things.
Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed.
Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it?
Is that what we are, Lannister?
An army of jesters in black?
You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.
I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing.
But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels-- half the boys you've seen training will die North of The Wall.
Might be a Wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold.
They die in pain.
And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.
Do you think I'm plump?
Listen, Benjen-- may I call you Benjen?
Call me what you like.
I'm not sure what I've done to offend you.
I have great admiration for The Night's Watch.
I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word "but"
really counts.
I don't believe that Giants and Ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond The Wall.
I believe that the only difference between us and the Wildlings is that when The Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.
The Wildlings are no different from us.
A little rougher maybe.
But they're made of meat and bone.
I know how to track them and I know how to kill them.
It's not the Wildlings giving me sleepless nights.
You've never been North of The Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.
Are you going below?
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.
Oh, I always do.
I think he's starting to like me.
- "Going below"?
Into the tunnel and out the other side.
He'll be North of The Wall for a month or two.
So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
Aye, day after tomorrow.
I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
Let's share the road.
I could use some decent company.
I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.
Not this time.
We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns.
No one turns away a Lannister.
At Jakar?
Athjahakar.
Ath ja haker.
Yes, Khaleesi.
Oh, what are you doing?
When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?
You change, Khaleesi.
For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle.
It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan.
But a man in full plate-- shori tawakof the arakh won't get through the steel.
That's where the broadsword has the advantage.
Designed for piercing plate.
- Armor.
Armor make a man...
- Vroz?
- Slow.
- Slow.
- It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.
He still is.
A man of great honor and I betrayed him.
I don't think she wants to eat dog.
The Khaleesi have baby inside her.
It is true.
She does not bleed for two moons.
Her belly start to swell.
She does not want to eat horse.
I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper.
I need to ride to Qohor.
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.
I'll catch you.
The horde's easy to find.
Don't stand so still.
It's harder to hit a moving target.
Except for you.
You move too much.
I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
Maester Aemon: How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?
Eight-- no, nine.
All of them brief?
They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.
This summer has lasted nine.
But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter.
The Starks are always right eventually: This one will be long and dark things will come with it.
We've been capturing Wildlings, more every month.
They're fleeing south.
The ones who flee say they've seen the White Walkers.
Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.
One of our own Rangers swore he saw them kill his companions.
He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond.
And it has has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men.
There are less than a thousand of us now.
We can't man the other castles on The Wall.
We can't properly patrol the wilderness.
We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed - and fed.
- Your sister sits by the side the King.
Tell her we need help.
When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.
I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.
It's either me or this cold.
And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
Will you stop at Winterfell on your way south?
I expect I will.
Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him.
Tell him I'd visit if I could.
Of course.
He'll never walk again.
If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple.
You take care, Snow.
Farewell, my Lord.
You are late, boy.
Tomorrow you will be here at midday.
Who are you?
Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.
Tomorrow you will catch it.
Now pick it up.
That is not the way, boy.
This is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it.
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong.
Just so.
One hand is all that is needed.
Now you are standing all wrong.
Turn your body sideface.
So.
You are skinny.
That is good.
The target is smaller.
Now the grip-- let me see.
The grip must be delicate.
What if I drop it?
The steel must be part of your arm.
Can you drop part of your arm?
Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos.
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.
I'm a girl.
Boy, girl-- you are a sword, that is all.
That is the grip.
You are not holding a battle-axe.
- You are holding--
- A Needle.
Ahhh.
Now we will begin the dance.
Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning-- the Knight's Dance, hacking and hammering.
This is the Bravo's Dance...
The Water Dance.
It is swift and sudden.
All men are made of water, do you know this?
If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die.
Now you will try to strike me.
Ha!
Up!
Dead.
Hup!
Very dead.
Ah ah ah!
Again, faster.
Man: But we have a Kingdom to look after.
Varys: His Grace has many cares.
- Go away!
Ned: Arya, open the door.
- One time she told me.
Man: Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of.
Commander: I don't need him to be charming.
Woman: Yes, I'm looking at you.
Jorah: Annakhas dozgosores.
- You dare!
- Shafki.
- Benjen: I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time.
Jorah: For a man on horseback, the curved blade...
- She does not want to eat horse.
- Hup!
- Syrio: Come.
- Hup!
- Still not far from Pentos, Your Grace.
Jon: I have something for you.
17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon.
- And now you're leaving again.
- Ned: I have no choice.
The Starks have manned The Wall for thousands of years.
And you are a Stark.
Tell me we're not speaking of this.
Rapers.
Lovely thing about The Watch-- you discard your old family and get a whole new one.
Catelyn: I don't think Bran fell from that tower.
Someone tried to kill him twice.
I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved.
- Lord Stark must be told of this.
- Catelyn: I will go myself.
Cersei: Joff told us what happened.
You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
Arya: That's not what happened!
- Ahh!
We found no trace of the direwolf, Your Grace.
- We have another wolf.
- As you will.
Lady didn't bite anyone!
She's good!
"Gossip Girl here, your one and only source into of the Manhattan elite.
- I get into Columbia.
- And what if Columbia's a disaster, and we lost each other for good?
- And what if it's amazing and we become closer than we've ever been?
I'm not seeing anybody else, nor do I want to, if you don't.
Last night... don't even finish those words unless... unless they end with "was a mistake."
Ben's my brother.
He takes a lot of time and energy.
The guys were easy, but the girls are presenting a little bit more of a challenge.
I know what you did, Blair.
It's despicable, even for you.
Do you hate me so much you can't stand to see me happy?
Why did you drive the person I care most about out of town?
You just brought back my worst self.
Morning on the Upper East Side, where even our own blonde birdie has been spotted flying the coop early to make it to her morning classes.
Leave it to Serena Van Der Woodsen to make geek chic.
Who knew Ivy would look so good on her?
Hey, you again.
Yes, me again, getting my cab taken by you again.
Nice bag.
I like it better than the one you had the other day.
It's supposed to be at class with me.
I can't be late again, so if don't mind...
She had an audition.
Something...
I think a talking dog was involved.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Why don't you let me make it up to you?
Buy you a drink sometime?
Are you seriously hitting on me while still holding your date's shoes?
Well, if you change your mind, the king Cole bar is the only place in town that still makes a red snapper.
You look like you're about a size 8?
Taxi!
Indra Nooyi, Ann Moore, Andrea jung.
Why are these all businesswomen?
We color-coded for easy reference.
Businesswomen are in green.
Women in academia are in blue.
Politics and government in red with a subsection on royalty and dictators.
Ooh, files.
What's going on?
Researching women of power so I can better forge my path to become one.
Sarah Louise Palin?
Do you even want to be a Minion?
B., uh, can I talk to you for a minute?
I need advice.
Five paces behind for privacy.
Ten for you.
How are you?
I've barely seen you all week.
Uh, I've been great.
You know, with Dan and Nate behind me, I really feel like I can bury the old me and start anew.
May you rest in peace.
The only problem is, I've been late for my English lit class a few times, and lates count as absences, which is 10%...
oh, if only there were a device of some kind to keep the time.
S., listen to me.
College professors have a God complex, so just meet with him and say you're sorry.
The simplest way to turn an enemy into a friend is to seek their counsel.
Who taught you that?
One of your Asian "art of war" gurus?
Martha Chamberlin.
She's guest lecturing a series called the psychology of business.
I'm heading to the registrar's to sign up.
Oh, I love her.
B., how do you do it?
Chuck declares war, and you simply up your class load.
The more time I spend on campus, the safer I am.
Chuck is allergic to education and bettering himself.
Well, I'm not, so if I'm gonna work on my new self, I should head to the library.
Sign me up for Martha's class.
We'll go together.
Your guitar tuner?
You have the worst poker face ever.
Dan hasn't been returning my calls, and I wanted to make sure everything was okay with you guys.
Everything is better than okay.
Dan and I had a marathon talk...
everything that we haven't dealt with, including Serena.
And from now on, there's no more secrets or surprises.
Well, that's great.
Never doubted you guys for a second.
Seriously?
You need to practice in the mirror or something.
I don't know how they let you live on the Upper East Side.
That's great you and Vanessa sorted everything out, Dan.
You know, we should double.
Juliet and I are going to this faculty and friends mixer tomorrow night at the Hamilton house.
You guys wanna come?
Mm, no.
There's free appetizers, Humphrey.
You wanna go see a movie afterward?
No can do.
Oh, come on.
It doesn't even have to have subtitles.
That sounds great.
No, Juliet and I have this nice little evening planned after the mixer.
Got some champagne, new Matteo sheets, and I'm hoping some recently purchased lingerie.
It's for her, right?
Wait a second.
You guys haven't, uh...
No, I haven't.
I did the spend the night at her place, but I took a page from the old Humphrey playbook, and we just talked and played scrabble.
That's nice.
By the way, thank you for, uh, inviting me today.
You know, after everything that's happened between us...
yeah, yeah.
I missed you, too.
No hugs.
You're not getting a hug.
Not one?
Not one.
I'm sorry I didn't visit last week.
Things are really ramping up at school.
The good news is that Serena is now isolated from both Dan and Nate.
What about Blair?
Blair will get distracted eventually.
It was only a few weeks ago I went after Serena at Hamilton house.
If I get caught trying to get her expelled, it's over.
Not if you have a fall guy.
Maybe...
Someone with pretty blue eyes and a history with Serena?
Have you been spying on me?
Spying implies a lack of trust, and I know that I can trust you.
I'm only dating Nate to stay in Serena's orbit.
Good, because we agreed that we would not stop until Serena was left with nothing, just like I was.
And the next thing to take from her is Columbia.
And seeing as how you're in with these people, it shouldn't be too hard, right?
I know what to do.
There you are.
Where do I sign up for Ms.
Chamberlin's lecture series?
Go, lions.
That's impossible, even for you.
The dean's extended me the courtesy of auditing a few classes.
We felt it was important I get a feel for campus life before breaking ground on the new Bart Bass memorial rotunda.
It's a building with a circular ground plan, usually covered by a dome.
I know what a rotunda is!
You can't be here.
Columbia's mine.
What do you want?
Funny, last time we spoke, I thought I was crystal clear.
You took away what I cared about most.
To return the favor, I'm going to take Columbia away from you.
Come back later and sign me and Serena up for Martha's class.
But do it quietly.
I don't want Chuck to know.
This just in...
looks like you can take the girl out of the party, but not the party out of the girl.
I'm livin' in the 21st century.
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice...
Rumor has it our favorite blonde could be spreading more than just good cheer.
And if it's true, then there's a test out there a few of you might not be able to pass.
Does s.V.W.
Have an s.T.D.?
I mean, who would lie to Gossip Girl like that?
Do you really want a list?
Because I don't know if I have that kind of time.
A good scandal is one thing, but even Gossip Girl likes to keep things classy and somewhat true.
I just wanted to focus on school.
Well, don't let this stop you.
Without someone confirming the rumor, it'll blow over by lunch.
And just keep doing what you're doing.
Hold your head high.
This is our school.
We were here first.
Damn him to hell.
Why do I get the feeling your pep talk is not entirely meant for me?
Chuck is here, at Columbia.
He's bringing the battle to campus?
Well, I already have a battle plan.
I found out that Martha Chamberlin takes a student assistant when she lectures.
That position will be my own private island against the storm that is Chuck Bass.
If you're not gonna let a disease like Chuck deter you, what leg do I have to stand on?
I'm gonna go plant myself in the quad, act like I don't have a care in the world, and e-mail my Professor to see when he can meet.
Okay, it says here that you both slept with Serena...
And Vanessa, and that Vanessa also slept with Chuck...
Who slept with Blair?
All that's on "Gossip Girl"?
Yeah, she made a chart, actually, which I have to say is very helpful.
Can we talk?
Thank you for meeting me before your game.
I thought that we should talk about this before we spend our first night together.
You know it's just a rumor.
It's not true.
And even if it was, I haven't slept with Serena since, like, last spring.
So I think I would, you know, know.
Nate, symptoms can be dormant for months or not even appear at all.
You could still be a carrier.
I paid attention in health class.
So you want me to get tested?
I mean, I'm not worried, but if it makes you feel better, I'll swing by the health clinic after the game.
And I promise you, when you see the outfit I bought for tomorrow night, it'll be well worth it.
Vanessa, like I told you on the phone, I'm sure it's totally false.
And...
and what business is it of yours anyway?
You and I both got tested when we first started sleeping together.
You remember that?
I sure do, and I have not been with anyone else since.
Dan, Serena was sleeping in your bed and wearing your t-shirt.
If something else happened, I need to know.
Nothing else happened.
W-what...
what happened to our big talk?
'Cause honestly, I don't know if I can have this same conversation one more time.
the blast freaked me out.
It's okay.
I promise you have nothing to worry about.
I'll call you after the game.
Serena.
Why wouldn't I be?
If you're referring to the unconfirmed vicious rumor on "Gossip Girl," you wouldn't have anything to do with that, would you?
Look, I just came over here to tell you the way our English lit Professor called you out in front of the entire class?
You didn't deserve that.
And if there's anything that I can do...
No, I already e-mailed him.
I'm hoping to talk with him myself tomorrow.
Well, anyhow...
I really didn't have anything to do with that blast.
Believe me, it's the last thing I would've wanted.
Nate sort of freaked when he saw it.
Freaked how?
He doesn't believe it.
Thanks for coming with me, man.
No problem.
I shouldn't have told you about the cotton swab thing.
That was insensitive.
But, you know, just think about how happy you'll be with a clean bill of health tomorrow, right?
It's been what, two years?
I'm a wingman.
You wanna go sign me in and I'll see you in there in a minute?
Yeah, I'll step away now.
All right, cool.
Nate, I know all about your summer of love from Chuck's little black book, and honestly, for your sake, I hope you do get tested.
But if you do it today, people will just think that you believe the blast.
You'll be confirming the rumor.
Please just wait a few days or go somewhere else.
Serena, there's someone else I need to do this for.
And right now she's my priority, not you.
Ms.
Chamberlin's largest client to date?
National rifle association.
She created the mama bears campaign, increased female membership by a third.
And the cherry pie?
Her first major success was branding a cherry pie recipe for "better homes and gardens."
How do you get from "better homes and gardens" to the n.R.A.?
It's a short trip, believe me.
Chamberlin?
I'm Blair Waldorf.
I'll be in your psychology of business class.
Well, nice to meet you.
I'm not having office hours yet...
actually, I was hoping we could discuss the assistant position.
I'm a big fan.
Unfortunately, the position has been filled.
By who?
Chamberlin, whatever Mr.
Bass has told you, I assure you, he has no interest in your class or any idea who you even are.
Thank you?
On the contrary, once I decided to rebrand the empire, there was only one name on my list.
We can talk more as I walk you to your limo.
Good day, Ms.
Waldorf.
If you have any questions regarding the class, Mr.
Bass will answer them.
Actually, it turns out Ms.
Chamberlin's class is overenrolled.
You didn't make the cut.
I almost forgot how much I used to enjoy your pie.
Better batten down the hatches, b.
Looks like your island in the storm was just hit by a Bass 5 hurricane.
Where are you off to?
Uh, campus.
My Professor agreed to meet with me during office hours.
Oh, good for you.
We can't let the men of our past define us.
They want us to lash out, lower ourselves to their level.
But it is our job to remain civilized.
So you're gonna let Chuck have the assistant position then?
I said "civilized, " not "lobotomized."
Oh, Ms.
Chamberlin.
So good of you to come.
Earl Grey, if I'm not mistaken?
What is going on?
It's better not to know.
Plausible deniability.
Waldorf, the only reason I agreed to meet with you is because your mother and I have crossed paths on occasion, and I felt it a professional courtesy.
Did you know that my mother remarried?
Amazing man.
Your point?
I was sorry to hear about your unfortunate divorce a few years ago.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, boy.
You and I both know that power is the greatest aphrodisiac...
except, of course, when women have it.
Your ex-husband, for example.
I mean, the nanny?
How cliche...
I'm listening.
My stepfather has surrounded himself with people who are not intimidated by a woman's success.
One of the partners at his firm is exceptionally attractive.
And I don't mean to sound forward, but I'd love to introduce you at the Hamilton house party tonight.
Well, I was going to be at the party anyway, so...
Well, then I'll make the call.
That is, of course, if the assistant position is still available.
Let's just say that nothing is set in stone.
Hmm.
Did you say scone?
No, no, no, no!
I don't care how late she is for her audition.
Flight attendant.
So quick to judge.
How's school going?
Terrible, which is why I can't be late.
You know, if it helps, I could get you a copy of my schedule so we can stop doing this.
Why would we want to do that?
You put a different girl into a cab every day.
If you think I would ever be one of them, you are out of your mind.
I think nothing of the sort.
In fact, I leave at this time on purpose, hoping to get to see you.
Then I'm taking the cab.
Scoot over.
Uh, uh, lily's not around, right?
Uh, she and Eric are visiting colleges.
It's just us.
Okay, well, there...
there's - there's a rumor going around that Serena has, um...
She has...
she has something.
Has something?
Please get there faster.
Y-you mean...
oh.
But there was a picture of me with Nate yesterday at the health center.
So now I'm pretty sure Vanessa thinks that something more than a kiss happened between me and Serena.
Well, did it?
No, no, and I've told her that a hundred times.
But she slept in the other room last night, and when I woke up, she wasn't there.
I-I mean, I thought you'd be glad that I was sharing with you.
I am.
But you're not gonna like what I have to say.
Serena is a formidable woman, and what you guys shared was a big love.
You can't blame Vanessa for being insecure.
So if you wanna be with her, you need to show her that she doesn't have anything to be worried about.
I've told her that, but I'm not gonna stop talking to Serena, cut her out of my life.
All I'm saying is, at least for right now, Vanessa needs to know that she's the only one you care about.
I need to talk to you.
Oh, I'm in a hurry.
Now's not a good time.
You need to tell me what happened between you and Dan that night.
Isn't that a conversation you should be having with him?
I did, but I can't trust him when it comes to you.
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's just say it wouldn't be the first time a guy had lied to his girlfriend to cover up a night spent with you.
You know, Vanessa, you always wanna believe the worst in people.
Why change now?
Exactly.
Glad to see you took me up on my offer.
I hope you like my signature martinis.
I'm tired of making dossiers and carrying cherry pies.
This would be good practice if I ever decide to take Blair down myself.
Well, don't get ahead of yourself, but I appreciate the enthusiasm.
What did you find out?
I just got your text.
What's up?
Yeah, I just found out that test results could take three or four days to get back.
Three or four days.
I can't believe our night's being derailed by this.
Unless...
There's another way that we can know for sure.
I mean, Serena must've talked or e-mailed someone about whether the rumors were true or not.
I guess I could talk to Blair.
She'd probably take the fifth.
How else are we gonna find out?
Forget it.
I just think the anticipation is making me crazy.
Well, I'm gonna go home.
We should both get ready.
And I am gonna start...
By taking a cold shower.
I think we're ready.
You think?
Oh, I can't just come out and ask him to steal Serena's phone.
But trust me, he's right where we need him to be.
If anything goes wrong, it'll be on him.
Just like we planned.
I have to go.
Vanessa.
What are you doing up here?
I think Dan and Serena slept together last spring when we were still going out.
Are you sure?
That's the problem.
They both deny it.
I'm sorry to unload on you like this.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Well, then you have to find out for sure.
How?
I think I might have an idea.
That is, of course, if you're up for it.
Right now I'm up for anything, believe me.
Then call Dan.
Tell him that you wanna talk and we'll meet him and Nate at Hamilton house tonight.
Trust me.
Things have a way of working out when you least expect it.
Where have you been?
I know I'm late.
Again.
So I take it the meeting with your Professor did not go well.
It didn't go at all.
I didn't make it.
You know there's a clock on your cell phone, right?
Yes, but it wasn't my fault, but I e-mailed him and begged for five minutes of his time tonight.
Then we settle all Columbia business tonight.
And it just so happens that Ms.
Chamberlin...
b., can I just wish you good luck and take plausible deniability on this one?
Luck not needed, but right back at ya.
You're a natural.
I said Serena forgot something.
One smile at the coat check guy and he handed it right over.
Now check her e-mail.
If Serena and Dan slept together, there's bound to be a message about the rumor.
This feels very wrong.
It's the only way you'll know for sure.
There's an e-mail from Dan a few hours ago.
"If Vanessa thinks "something more than a kiss happened between us "even though it didn't, I need to show her I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make things work."
Well, now you have your answer.
We have to put this back right now.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
My boyfriend dated her, too.
You're not the only one with Serena insecurity.
Okay, well, then hurry up.
Shoot.
I think someone's coming.
Coast is clear.
Well?
Nothing, thank God.
Let's get outta here.
Okay, wait.
I told Dan that I needed to talk.
What...
what do I say now?
He's a guy.
Do you think he really wants to talk?
Just take him home and show him you're ready to move on.
Twice if necessary.
Nate's a lucky guy.
You guys make a really good couple.
Yeah, we do, don't we?
Pardon the interruption, but you have an important call.
Blair Waldorf.
I'm Ms.
Chamberlin's new assistant.
Confident, I see.
When destiny calls?
Always.
Especially when it arrives right on time.
Nothing says "soul mate" like punctuality.
Hey, Vanessa.
Dan.
Nate, um, Juliet's looking for you.
I just mean, like, why are you - why are you smiling so much?
I'm - I'm glad to see you.
I thought...
I thought you were mad at me.
I'm...
I'm confused here.
Okay, wait a second.
Now...
now...
now I'm really confused.
You...
you said we needed to talk.
We already did.
I wasn't listening.
What do you say we get out of here?
And I'll show you how much we don't need to talk.
I'm pretty stubborn.
It might take all night.
Well, then I guess you'll need your strength.
Let's load up on free appetizers before we leave.
Hamilton house is where dreams come true.
On that we agree.
Shall we?
Beautiful scarf.
Oh, well, as we work together, you'll come to find that your tastes are my tastes.
Guess who.
Sam.
I must say, Blair did not do you justice.
I know the feeling.
You thought this was my special someone?
I mean, unless...
Since I'm a powerful career-driven woman who intimidates men, I must be a lesbian?
This was not the date I set up.
He was an intellectual property lawyer who does pro Bono work helping kids sue Hollywood for stealing their Twitter ideas.
Then I suggest you see if he needs an assistant.
My class is full...
forever.
Great scarf, by the way.
Dean Reuther, Serena Van Der Woodsen.
Professor Lawford, I'm so sorry I didn't make our meeting this morning.
But as I mentioned in my e-mail, I'm hoping to impress upon you...
upon both of you...
that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to succeed at this school.
Yes, the e-mail that you sent to Professor Lawford makes that pretty clear.
I'm sorry?
Perhaps we should have this conversation in private.
And what conversation would that be?
The one regarding your e-mail that offers sex for grades.
I-I-I didn't do that.
I would never do that.
This is your e-mail address, is it not?
Yes, but I-I didn't send this.
Van Der Woodsen, obviously we pay no mind to childish rumors that circulate all college campuses, but this e-mail is extremely serious.
The consequence of sending it, I'm afraid, is expulsion.
Expulsion?
Spotted...
Serena Van Der Woodsen looking like she's hot for teacher.
That's the thing about a good gaslight...
with enough smoke, who cares if there's really a fire?
Did you send that e-mail, the one that came from Serena's phone offering sex to her Professor?
Why would I do that?
If you ask me, it sounds like an idea that Serena would get all on her own.
I don't think she would do that.
I'm gonna tell her we had her phone.
Don't.
Maybe if we had access to it, then somebody else did as well.
I didn't send that e-mail.
But if you tell her that we took her phone, she is gonna blame us, and I could get expelled.
And so could she.
If you didn't send it, then you have nothing to worry about.
Where is Martha's date?!
Penthouse suite at the empire with a woman I assure you he won't want to leave until morning, maybe afternoon.
Depends on his cardio.
I was going to play nice.
You think I don't have a plan "b"?
Plan "b"?
What could be more cunning and devious than date night?
I had Dorota get chummy with Martha's maid, who came over from one of her sweatshops in the Philippines.
If I have to, I'll blackmail her for the position.
An illegal maid scandal?
Nobody's cared about those in years.
And a lesbian switcheroo doesn't make you Blackwater.
The switcheroo was for fun.
The I.R.S.
Agent standing by to crawl up Martha's audit is not.
A tax fraud setup?
They give away girl scout badges for that.
I have her prenup.
It has details.
I have the nanny.
She has pictures.
Martha's ex is in them.
So is Martha.
It turns out it was a threesome until the nanny turned it into a twosome.
You students are psychotic.
I have better things to do with my time.
Tell the dean I quit.
Shame.
Sounded like a great class.
If you'll excuse me, I've heard good things about the make-your-own-pizza bar.
My phone isn't in here.
Whoever stole it must've been the person that sent the e-mail.
A missing cell phone is hardly proof.
I'll see you in my office on Monday, and we'll talk about what's next.
Good night, Jim.
Please don't do this.
You don't go to Columbia.
They can't do anything to you.
I'm sorry, but it's the right thing to do.
Serena...
Call your phone.
Maybe the person who stole it might still be here.
Hey, what's going on?
Vanessa stole my phone and sent an e-mail to my Professor.
That's...
that's crazy.
Do you wanna answer that?
I'll speak with you later.
I can explain.
You took Serena's phone?
She thinks we slept together.
Wait, you were the one behind the "Gossip Girl" rumor.
I-I know how this looks, but I did not send out that e-mail.
Juliet did.
She's the one who wanted to steal your phone in the first place.
W...
are you kidding me?!
There is no way that I'm getting dragged into this.
I wasn't gonna say anything, but Vanessa came to me today.
She asked me to help her get revenge, and I told her no.
That is a lie!
Juliet told me before the party.
She was hoping to talk to Vanessa and calm her down.
I'm sorry, man.
Wait, is that why you were so happy earlier and you wanted to get outta here?
Yeah, with my phone, so that she could get rid of the evidence and make sure I was expelled.
I did not do this.
After everything we've been through, I'm asking you to please believe me.
I don't know what to believe right now.
Vanessa...
don't.
I'm sorry, okay?
I-I wanted to be friends, but what did you expect me to do?
I had to protect myself.
You do.
Poor v.
Didn't she know that in love and war, a friend in need is willing to do most any deed?
I believe you didn't send that e-mail, but I can't ignore the level of drama that has followed you to my campus and grown even louder since you arrived.
Meaning?
Women of my generation had to fight for every opportunity and to be taken seriously, and your attitude, Ms.
Van Der Woodsen, makes a mockery of that.
If I were you, I would rethink my priorities.
Good night.
Waldorf, I have my eye on you as well.
Plausible deniability was a good call.
And speaking of denials, you've been cleared in the court of public opinion.
Gossip Girl sent out an official retraction and personal apology to you about the rumor.
Not to mention, she said whatever person sent it is now on her hit list.
Yeah, well, it was Vanessa.
Vanessa?
Yeah, well, Gossip Girl's scorn will only increase her social standing.
How did you figure it out?
Uh, ironically, it was Juliet who I have to thank for that.
If you'll excuse me.
I was just telling Blair I have you to thank for clearing my name.
I know we got off on the wrong foot, but...
It's just because I was jealous of how much you meant to Nate, and I'm sorry.
Well...
Boys will do it almost every time.
Now if they weren't so darn cute...
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
Do you maybe wanna grab a drink with us?
I actually just wanna get outta here.
I'll see you in class.
Don't be late.
What are you still doing here?
I lost the assistant position.
The entire faculty thinks I'm just as crazy as you.
You've made your point.
Can't you take your little celebration elsewhere?
If you think I'd take tonight as some sort of balancing of the scales, I don't.
I'm not trying to make a point, Blair.
This is just a warm-up.
Whatever you want, wherever you want it, I am going to be there to take it away from you.
I won't stop until you have nothing.
You wouldn't go that far.
Who knows my limits since you took away my future?
That wasn't your future.
That was Henry prince's.
Destroying me won't make you happy.
Happier.
The only thing that will make you happy, you lost the moment you slept with Jenny Humphrey.
And that was the best thing that ever happened to me, because...
I got over you forever.
If that's the truth, then why haven't you told anyone about Jenny?
Not your family, not your minions, not Gossip Girl.
I know you're not keeping that secret to protect me.
You wouldn't.
That revelation would result in mutual destruction.
You may be homicidal, but you're not suicidal.
A man with nothing to live for is capable of anything.
I'm gonna stay with my parents for a little while.
that's probably a good idea.
I think I could use some time alone, too.
Dan, it's really important to me that you know I didn't start any rumors or send out that e-mail.
I-I believe you, I think.
But it doesn't change the fact that you didn't believe me.
I know that now.
It's just too bad that it took losing you to figure it out.
The red snapper.
Excellent choice.
What do you think?
I think it's a bloody Mary with an inferiority complex.
Fair enough.
So...
Drinking alone, are we?
You've made it pretty clear you're out of my league.
What do you have to lose by answering?
I'd prefer not to encourage this kind of behavior.
Tell you what.
One drink, one question.
Tell me why you're drinking alone, and I'll tell you anything you want.
I thought I could start over, but it turns out college is just high school with more expensive books.
There's no...
starting over.
No matter where I go, whatever I do, my past seems to follow me.
Why are you with a different girl every night?
Because I stopped apologizing for my past a long time ago.
Does that really work?
Does that actually make you happy?
It did.
The law of affinity refers to unlikely compositions forming a bond through a purely chemical reaction.
Now I'm feeling so...
Why didn't you stick to the plan?
Like I said the first time, I thought Vanessa was the better option.
Well, she wasn't.
Serena didn't get expelled.
But now I'm in with Serena, and I can become her confidant and find something even bigger to take her down with.
Good, 'cause now you have no choice.
And I'd better not find out that this was about protecting Nate.
If you're falling for him...
I'm not.
I swear.
G-get them bottles poppin'.
I guess I have to trust you.
Now get me two more bottles
Yeah, I guess you do.
But even the strongest bonds have their limits...
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk?
Poppin' bottles in the ice and when broken...
That 808 bump make you put your hands up?
You sure about this?
Mm-hmm.
Now that we know Vanessa was behind the rumors...
Absolutely.
That if left unchecked...
explode like a nuclear bomb.
Veronica, do you still work with Tim Gunn?
I need to get an interview for someone who will be applying to Parsons.
Yeah, her name's Jenny Humphrey.
Waiting for the fallout.
X.O.X.O., Gossip G.
Joff told us what happened.
That's not what happened!
Ahh!
A Passenger jet bound for Chicago out of Hong Kong was forced to make an emergency landing.
People just started getting sick.
There are no survivors.
Going somewhere?
You, the goddamn DEA.
- Is it true?
I'd like our last moments together to be more...
Memorable.
If you have any hopes of surviving tonight, you will tell me everything I want to know.
I know what you're thinking, Mr.
Galan, but you just...
Roll him up.
- Sir, this is ridiculous.
- Now.
You gotta believe me.
I'm not some government agent.
I'm just a guy who tried...
don't lie to me, don't insult me, and don't tell me what to believe.
How long have I been targeted?
How much do you know?
Oh, you think now is an honorable time for you to keep your silence?
But, Tony, there's something you have to remember.
Maritza.
Javier.
Ricardo.
Cristina.
You introduced me to your whole family.
You brought me into your home.
I hope you never have to regret that decision.
None of this was my idea.
They approached me.
Actually, it was more like they kidnapped me.
You know, you should really think about washing that thing.
Smells like somebody died in it.
Please tell me no one died in that hood.
Who are they?
A division of the CIA that wouldn't take no for an answer.
And what did they want from you?
They wanted me to play soccer.
The L.A.
Riot are having open tryouts.
There are two rounds of evaluations.
We need you to make it past the first.
Try out for a professional soccer team?
I thought it was a joke at first till I realized it wasn't.
They wanted access to you.
They said you were involved with some network that was creating debt crises, civil wars.
They wanted me to get inside.
And you were only too happy to oblige.
At first I turned them down.
But they had leverage.
Brother's coming up for parole.
On the off chance you weren't compelled by competitive spirit, we thought that we should have a plan B.
And what is that, exactly?
You complete the mission, we'll make sure Ricky comes home.
If I didn't do the job, Ricky was gonna suffer.
Didn't have a choice.
We all have a choice.
You made the wrong one.
Pick him up.
You know, if you're so convinced that I'm your enemy, then you killed the wrong guy.
I have many enemies, and the night is young.
We've got 375 dead aboard flight 409, passengers and crew.
We believe they died from the same plague that wiped out the Ze'Otec tribe.
And the virus was delivered by way of an oxygen tank?
By a 112-year-old man.
Presumably an agent of the network.
Yeah, one willing to carry out a suicide mission.
Is there evidence this courier worked for Galan's organization?
Agent Peacott?
I'm sorry, what?
I asked if you found a direct link between Galan's network and this courier.
Uh, yeah, we're piecing it together right now.
I've just been going through the footage to make sure there's nothing we missed.
Well, keep me posted.
You sure he's okay?
I can only go on what the doctors tell me, and they said he's fine.
All right, well, I want him on desk duty until I say otherwise.
Where's Bravo?
Uh, he should be on his way.
He must have got delayed.
So what's the plan here, Mr.
Galan?
Covering up a murder is not as easy as it sounds.
People make mistakes.
I learned a few things in the DEA, things that might help you come out of this clean.
Letting you help me was my first mistake.
Or don't you remember?
You came to me with an offer of loyalty, one I should have refused.
You really gotta know, my priorities are entirely with this team.
My loyalty is to you.
And this just a day after your date at the auction made away with an artifact that was rightfully mine.
The two of you were a team.
- That's not how it was.
- Of course.
It was just a coincidence that you were then in a position to offer your help in getting back and she just guessed that it would be a good idea to swap it out.
It's a fake!
Who was she?
She fooled me too.
Tony, for a man whose job is lying, you're doing a piss-poor job.
That was your pattern...
to get close to me, to buy my trust.
You were never going to see the big picture.
You get that?
I gave you only trifling jobs, no more.
You were never going to get any deeper.
So don't imagine you've accomplished anything here more than you have.
I haven't accomplished anything.
I got a plane full of dead people, and I'm guessing there's more where that came from.
You could help me stop it.
I wish that were true.
Where's the Camaro I bought you?
I lent it to my brother Ricky.
He wanted it for a date.
Open the trunk.
Put him in there.
He won't fit.
Try harder.
You drive.
The CDC's latest statement urges the public to remain calm, but that's done little to stem the tide of speculation about the threat of future outbreaks.
It's not just speculation, is it?
You know there's gonna be more attacks.
I told you, I know nothing of the sort.
He can shuffle the lineup all he wants...
is that why you sent Senna out of the city?
To the house in Palm Springs?
No argument there, but, come on, you must know something.
We've got another Riot fan on the line.
Rick from Boyle heights, you're on the air.
Talk to me.
Hey, Jay, first-time listener, longtime caller.
Just wanted to get your opinion on last week's amazing performance by Tony Bravo, rising star of the L.A.
Riot.
Whoa, whoa, hold up.
Tony Bravo?
The Matador, yo.
That's still a thing?
He hasn't even scored a goal yet.
Is that your fucking brother?
It's not the goals.
It's the performance.
And that would be a no.
Not one goal.
It's been nice talking to you, Rick from Boyle heights.
For all the latest Tony Bravo news and merchandise, that's about all I can take of that guy.
We need to pay some bills, more...
Just think how foolish your brother's going to feel when he finds out this is all a lie.
But it's not, though.
When it came to the soccer, it was all real.
Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to play on a real club.
Oh, stop.
This is so pathetic.
Answer it.
On speaker.
Anne, what's up?
Tony, where are you?
I've been trying to reach you.
I was at the party kind of late, sorry.
Uh, well, we had a meeting tonight, remember?
With the Red Bull Execs, we were supposed to meet them at 10:30.
Yeah, I must have lost track of time.
Where are you now?
I'm heading home.
Uh, well, do you think you could drop by the W?
You know, I could try and keep them here a little longer.
No, I'm beat.
I think I'm just gonna call it a night.
Maybe we should reschedule.
So tell them I'm sorry.
Try and get some sleep.
Bravo's phone.
GPS has him heading north, about 40 miles outside of Glendale.
Wherever he's going, it's not home.
Your agent is diligent.
Yeah, she's a real pit bull.
When I cut you from the team, she stormed into my office as if she was on a mission.
What's this bullshit about you rescinding his contract offer?
Well, maybe she was.
I don't think I've ever known anyone represent a virtually unknown client with such vigor.
She's in on it too, isn't she?
Isn't she?
Bravo's in trouble.
We think he's been taken captive.
What do we know?
He's in a moving car with someone.
We assume it's Samuel.
Assemble an intercept team.
- On it.
- Not you.
I don't care what the doctors say.
You're not ready to go back in the field.
For all we know, there's another infected plane in the air already.
I need you here, working leads.
Looks like we got a flat.
I didn't know that.
I'm just saying.
I'm gonna go and fix it, if that's all right.
I'll go with you.
Ah, shit!
My lug wrench, think I must have left it at my mom's house.
I helped her patch a tire.
Must have forgot to put it back in.
Well, that's an unfortunate turn of events.
Looks like it's our lucky day.
Handle them.
Yo.
Looks like you got yourself a flat tire.
Me and my brother, we could fix it for you.
For $100.
It's cool, man.
I'm a mechanic.
I can handle it.
Yeah, well, maybe you just want to give us $100 anyway.
Look, man, we don't want any trouble.
Trouble-free, that's a good policy.
I don't think I have $100.
We'll take what you got.
Here.
Gentlemen, we won't be requiring your services this evening, but we could use your lug wrench.
Now change the goddamn tire.
So I missed my connecting flight, which was frustrating, but something went wrong.
I'm thankful too that whatever, you know, killed those people, you know, we don't want that getting out.
You gotta be kidding me.
That was a nice clothesline back there.
Lucha libre, I used to watch every match when I was a kid, unless it conflicted with futbol.
That was my first love.
I was four.
In my village in Oaxaca, we played on a pasture...
inhaling dust and stepping in cow shit.
My first ball was a stitched-up cow bladder, can you believe it?
Still, I loved it.
Me too.
I guess it was something I learned from my father.
Javi?
No, my real father.
Where is he now?
He died when I was six.
We have Bravo's phone signal from the vehicle just ahead.
Two males.
Closing in now.
Out of the car now!
Get out of the vehicle now!
- Get on the ground.
- Hands up.
Turn around.
Face the vehicle.
Interlock your fingers behind your head.
Spread 'em.
- Trunk's clear.
- Car's clear.
I think I found something.
A phone.
Mason.
It's Bravo's.
Damn it.
What is this place?
It's the site of Unafonica's next cellular base station.
They're pouring the second slab of foundation next Thursday.
Keys.
Get him out of there.
I did have a choice.
I took the mission, but it wasn't just about getting Ricky out of jail, it was about me.
This was my chance to live my dream.
That's very touching.
Start digging.
Galan...
- Make it deep, enough for two.
Just wait.
Look, it doesn't have to go down like this.
If you knew some of the things I've done, Tony, you would know it has to go down exactly like this.
Dig!
Over there.
You don't even know it, but I'm on your side.
Gone out of my way to protect you.
I'm serious.
In Nicaragua, during that futsal game, there was gonna be a DEA raid that day.
Everyone there would've been taken.
But you never even knew about it 'cause I stopped it.
This raid is going down, and if we want our OP to continue, we have to keep Galan clear of it.
If I didn't, you'd probably still be in a DEA holding cell.
Oh, Tony, please.
It's the truth.
Suppose it is.
All you did was save yourself and your mission.
That's not something you did for me.
All right, fine.
When Moktar Zola kidnapped Senna and held her captive in the stadium, I knew all about it because of the bug in your office.
But what you didn't know is, I violated orders to save her.
My handlers didn't care about Senna, as long as they got Intel on you.
But that didn't sit right with me, so I got myself red-carded and sent off so that I could find her and get her out of there, all in direct violation of my orders.
Otherwise, your daughter would be dead.
When I said that I was just lucky to be in the right place at the right time, that was the lie.
I was there because I chose to be.
There must have been another reason.
Yeah, because I know what it's like for a family to be torn apart.
Your father...
what happened to him?
Car accident.
He drove off the road, hit a transformer.
Whole car went up.
That must have been hard.
I remember how he was before the crash.
He was different.
It was like he knew something was gonna happen.
He was scared.
Scared?
Of what?
A couple weeks earlier, we were at a park where we always went.
We were playing soccer, like a hundred other times.
And then this old woman...
suddenly she starts screaming at him.
She kept screaming at him, something that sounded like a name.
Camille, Camille.
Where did your parents come from, Tony?
Chiapas, why?
No reason.
After that day, my father changed.
He was nervous, distant.
Couple weeks later, he was dead.
Both have extensive records, but the stories were consistent.
Both identify photos of Tony and Galan as the men whose flat they offered to fix.
And the cell was stashed in the wiper well?
Galan must have put it there to lead us astray.
At least we know Tony's alive.
Or was, three hours ago.
Whatever, you know, killed those people, you know, we don't want that getting out.
This...
you know, the airport officials and the police...
they've been on top of Th...
that face look familiar to you?
Should it?
Next video, here we go.
This was taken the day of Haik Katoyan's alleged suicide.
He used to a pretty sociable guy, but the last few months, something was different...
I don't know...
it's the same guy.
This here is what they call a crisis actor, somebody whose purpose is to spread a message that supports...
I know what a crisis actor is.
Nice catch.
Find him.
Bring him in.
It wasn't a spur-of-the-moment thing, was it?
Killing him?
You must have thought about it a lot.
You couldn't control him.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Well, I know he pulled a gun on you the day Zola kidnapped your daughter in your office.
If you don't get me the information I seek, I will kill your daughter and make you watch.
Make the call.
He would've killed you for making that call.
Hang up the phone!
You die if you do this.
- Better me than my daughter.
- Both of you!
And that's when we realized that you weren't the one calling the shots.
Samuel answered to someone else.
Drop it, Tony.
You'll kill me?
It's not that I couldn't trust him.
It's because he would've exposed me for allowing a mole, you, into this organization!
You're afraid.
It's only gonna get worse, once the other members of your group realize that you've exposed them.
We've got names.
I've seen the list.
There is no list.
Then what about all those other people visiting the Adaptive Wellness clinic?
Guys at the office say it's a real "who's who" of the 1%.
If such a list exists, give me one name on that list besides my own.
Gene Belasco.
Gene's a friend of mine.
You think I wouldn't know if he was part of this?
You don't even know who the other people are, do you?
You really are screwed.
What do you think happens when they find out that you've killed one of your own?
You can't stay public.
What, you go off the grid?
Looking over your shoulder, you and Senna?
Or are you gonna drag her down with you?
You're trapped.
The government on one side and your own people on the other, there's no place to hide.
And I suppose you have an alternative.
Turn yourself in.
Tell us what you know.
Help us take them down.
It's better one enemy than two, right?
And why should I trust you?
Because, believe it or not, Mr.
Galan, I actually like you.
You've done right by me and my family.
I just think you got into bed with the wrong people and things just got out of hand.
I don't wanna burn you.
I just need whatever happened on that plane to not happen again.
If you help us, I promise, I will protect you.
It's only been eight hours.
We'll find him.
Yeah, but in what condition?
If Bravo is still alive, finding and interrogating this crisis actor is still the best lead to find out where he is.
Or you could just ask me.
Oh, yeah, I hope it's okay.
I brought a plus-one.
Nicely done, Bravo.
Bagged the white whale.
But?
But nothing.
It's a real coup.
Learn to take a compliment, jeez.
Keep in mind, immunity is contingent upon your assistance having a significant and beneficial impact on the investigation.
You hold back, and I pull it.
Agent and player together again.
You played your role well, Ms.
Spencer.
Or whatever your name is.
Let's just stick with that one for now.
If you ever leave the CIA, let me know.
Maybe I could use you.
I'll keep that in mind.
What do you know about the virus?
I wish to emphasize that I had no idea that terrorism was on the agenda.
So it was just a coincidence that the artifact you dug up in Nicaragua contained the virus that killed all of the passengers on flight 409.
Coincidence would be the wrong word.
Then give me a better one.
I would say it was a deception.
Galan, you need to tell her what she wants to know.
If you want immunity, if you want to be there for Senna, this is the only way.
See, in order for you to understand my situation, I have to go back.
I have to go back to explain to you how I arrived at this point.
I was recruited in 2003 by Gideon Khan, who I met at the reception for the Natural History Museum.
Khan.
We've crossed paths with him before.
Yeah, Bravo's first mission.
Khan was carrying the satellite frequency codes.
Gideon recognized me as what he called "a forward-thinking person."
He spoke of a global network of like-minded individuals who were looking to maximize their influence and profit potential.
By what means?
Through a coordinated mobilization of resources.
Who's they?
What do you call yourselves?
The Lamarck Foundation.
Membership has its privileges.
"The Lamarck Foundation.
Founded in 1887 by statesmen, businessmen, and scientists, dedicated to the progressive-era ideals of scientific and social progress."
Sounds like a wild bunch.
But the group was dissolved in 1914 on the Eve of World War I.
Or they just went underground.
But for many in the network, there was a more personal reason for...
for them to be members.
Let me guess...
living forever.
Longevity.
Radical life extension.
The promise of living to see how the world will change for decades to come.
Even longer.
Oh, it's nothing.
you're a smart man, Mr.
Galan.
I'm surprised you'd be taken in by the promise of immortality.
Yeah, like you, I was skeptical at first.
If Lucien Sayer's miracle drug really does what he claimed, it would be a goldmine for pharmaceutical companies.
You know about Sayer?
The drug is just a primer.
It has to be supplemented with the application of mitochondria, new mitochondria from young and healthy individuals.
Harvest the mitochondria, multiply them, then place them into the cells of patients like myself.
Has it worked for you?
It's hard to tell.
I haven't been on it for long, but it seems to have done very well for Dr.
Sayer.
So you're saying you've met Lucien Sayer?
He's the current head of the foundation.
I met him in London in 2010.
I'd been part of the group for a few years, I suppose Dr.
Sayer decided I was ready for the next step.
Exponential advances in science only occur with the right amount of brainpower and the right amount of capital.
I supply the former.
You provide the latter.
Money, yes, you're certainly asking for a lot of that.
Hardly, given the rewards.
And I can deliver.
What if I'm not around when these advances become available?
Have faith, Andres.
If you make it to 80, I can help you live to 125.
By the time you are 125, we'll have the means to get you to 200.
Sounds plausible when you put it like that.
Look at me.
How old would you say I am?
Early 50s.
I'm almost 70.
The treatment works.
Mitochondrial replacement is only the beginning, a stop-gap.
But believe me, there are new and amazing discoveries in the field almost every day.
Sayer was talking about the Ze'Otec civilization about a year ago.
He assigned me the job of acquiring one of their relics.
At the Brenton's auction.
But the acquisition didn't quite go to plan.
There was some sort of hiccup with my line of credit, which I now suspect was no mistake.
Anyway, our failure to secure the artifact necessitated our trip to Nicaragua.
So you secured the virus through another Ze'Otec artifact.
I was deceived.
Sayer told me the Ze'Otecs had a distinctive DNA, a survivor gene that would naturally extend the human lifespan.
You facilitated the worst bioterrorism act this country has ever seen.
You were crucial at every stage of the process.
I would never knowingly be party to something so horrific.
And why should we believe you?
Do you know what's wrong with dead people, hmm?
They don't buy things.
You can't sell them a smartphone with an unlimited data plan.
God knows I'm no Saint, and I've been accused of many things in my life, but one thing I've never been accused of is not trying to make a profit.
That is a very nice speech, Mr.
Galan, but right now all I care about is stopping the next attack.
And if you can't help me with that, then you're no good to me.
You need to reach out to Sayer.
I can't do that.
He mistrusts me already.
Well, then reach out to someone else in the network and find out what they know.
The network is compartmentalized.
No single member knows more than coup of others, at most.
There may be a way.
Tony said you have some kind of list.
A list of members' names, of people I might not know?
What about it?
Let me look at the list.
Perhaps I can reach out, see what they know.
We could do that ourselves.
No, you don't have my kind of access.
You are not one of them.
We'll consider it.
One other thing.
Do you know this man?
- Get down!
Get down!
- Don't do it!
Don't do it!
Hands behind your back.
Not a chance in hell.
We are not turning Galan into an asset, and we are definitely not giving him that list.
What are you afraid of?
I'm cautious.
Maybe you should try it.
It means you gave privileged information to a target of our investigation.
You don't know how someone like Galan could use that.
Tony turned him, and that is the important thing.
Really, Annie?
If you took a moment to stop defending him, you might be able to see things more clearly.
I understand your reservations, but at this stage, we don't have any options.
We have the crisis actor in custody now.
That is a solid lead, and we're gonna follow it.
Of course, but why not use Galan as well?
Because I don't trust him.
Doesn't matter anyway.
After we finish interrogating Galan, he'll never see the light of day.
You can't do that.
We made a deal.
There is no deal, Tony.
I gave him my word, Annie.
This is not the DEA.
When it comes to matters of national security, so-called immunity agreements are worthless.
Once we've got what we need, Andres Galan goes away for good.
I think he's on the verge, sir.
I don't think that'll be necessary.
Furman, is it?
It's time.
I know you're gonna tell us everything eventually.
Let's not make this any more unpleasant than it has to be.
So you're the good cop, then?
Let's save some time here.
We know you work for the Lamarck Foundation, but you're not exactly leadership, are you?
Leaders don't stick their necks out.
That'd be too dangerous.
That's work for loyal soldiers like you.
But to keep you properly motivated, they made some grand promises...
promises like wealth and immortality.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I suppose they've downplayed the risks, told you that they had influence everywhere.
Strings they could pull if you ever got caught doing their dirty laundry.
Do you know who I answer to, Mr.
Furman?
The president?
Nobody.
I have total discretion to handle you exactly as I please.
In this place, there are no strings to pull.
We don't have rules, we don't extend rights, and this goes on until I say it stops.
Here's what we wanna know.
We want to know who gives you your assignments, what do you know about the attack on flight 409, and are further attacks being planned?
So you let us know when you're ready.
Flight 409 wasn't a terrorist attack.
It was a test.
A test that killed 375 people.
And yielded data.
Valuable data.
Look, the virus killed too fast.
In fact, it never made it off the plane to spread the disease.
But it's being modified.
It'll work better next time kill slower, spread wider.
Who's modifying the virus?
- Lucien Sayer?
- I don't know who that is.
And here I thought we had an understanding!
- Was it Lucien Sayer?
- Yes, Lucien Sayer.
What do you know about his plan?
What I know can be summarized in just one sentence: You're all going to die.
- Noah, what's up?
- Just talked to Billie.
Her team's been breaking down our witness's laptop, and they found something.
Data's coming through now.
Next time it won't be just one plane.
They're hitting every city at once.
We're talking millions dead in a matter of days.
Are we sure they're capable of slowing the kill rate in order to increase the rate of infection?
Given how quickly they reanimated the virus, it's entirely possible they could engineer it to make it more dangerous.
Sir, if virus 2.0 is coming, we don't have time to spend working another target.
I agree, it's risky to trust Galan, but it's more risky not to trust him.
We need to find that virus, and fast, before it's disseminated.
You get your wish.
We flip Galan.
He gets immunity.
You'll be his handler.
I'll hold you responsible for his actions.
Yes, sir.
I cannot do what you ask without protection.
Sayer is an extremely cautious man.
He subjects even his closest allies to the highest level of scrutiny.
Then put on your game face.
You need to get deeper inside Lamarck.
If I suddenly demand a larger role in the operation, is thought to be suspicious.
I need a foolproof exit plan.
There's no such thing.
That's the risk you agreed to take.
Maybe we're going about this wrong.
We shouldn't be trying to get Galan to reach out to Sayer.
We should be trying to get Sayer to reach out to Galan.
If you have an actual plan, I am all ears.
Ears are fine.
Your nose...
you might wanna plug.
Oh, god.
What are we supposed to do with him?
Bring him back from the dead.
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos in his mouth.
Fifteen?
Your personal best!
Where were you?
On a date.
I met this girl on a train going to a museum upstate.
-Which museum?
-How'd you meet her?
Answer his.
We were at the back of the train.
I sat near the door so she'd have to pass by me...
If she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.
Were you so late because you were burying this woman?
I'm late because she lives in Poughkeepsie.
She seems great, but she's two and a half hours away.
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie?
That joke would have killed in Albany.
Done!
I did it.
Who's stupid now?
The One with the Girl From Poughkeepsie.
Look!
They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
That paper is two weeks old.
Who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?
I really wanted to take Kathy to this.
At least you have somebody to miss stuff with.
I hate being alone this time of year.
Next it's Valentine's Day...
Then my birthday, then bang!
Before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again.
I want somebody!
You know, I want a man!
It doesn't even have to be a big relationship.
Just a fling!
I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Let me tell you, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
There are nice guys in my office.
Want me to set you up?
I've been single a long time.
Why haven't you offered before?
I have a girlfriend.
I'm happy.
I no longer go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
No accountants.
And no one from "legal."
I don't like boring jobs.
And Ross was what?
A lion tamer?
What's wrong, Mon?
Everybody at work still hates me.
Is it because of the review you wrote or something new?
It's the review.
I was making headway.
Everyone was smiling at me, and then I get off work...
And find out they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Maybe they meant to write "Quiet, Bitch."
What's the matter?
Fine!
Just trying to be nice.
I haven't been picked on this much since kindergarten.
And they brought in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
They're trying to make me quit.
If it were any other job, I would.
But I've waited for this my whole life.
Wait, you're the boss.
Yell at them.
Or fire them!
I would love to, but I can't.
I'm not good at confrontation.
You know what you can do?
I read about this director, Orson Welles...
Who, at the beginning, would hire somebody just to fire them.
Then they would all know who was boss.
I'm not doing anything.
Why not fire me?
It's a good idea.
Can you waiter?
Good enough to get fired.
You're hired!
That's why I got fired last week!
Does Orson Welles direct commercials?
I say, Drew?
Are you seeing anybody right now?
I'm not asking for me.
I'm not gay.
I'm not asking you out.
I didn't think you were gay.
I do now.
My friend, Rachel, wants to be set up.
I just got out of a big relationship.
I'm not looking to get serious.
That's okay.
A fling might be all right with her.
Is this "Hot Rachel" that you took to the Christmas Party?
By the way, that is her full name.
Wow!
I'm free for her.
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.
Let's talk it over at the Ranger game.
Hold on.
I just got a box of Cubans.
I'll bring them by your office at five.
That's a little later than I usually stay, but sure.
Before the game, we could enjoy some eight-year-old Basil Haydens.
I don't know what that is, but that's a pretty nice jacket.
Kind of like that tie too.
Keep your pants on, man.
I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.
Do you want to hear it?
Happy Hanukkah, Monica.
May your Christmas be snowy, Joey.
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross.
Spin the dreidel, Rachel.
Pheebs, that's great!
But you know, Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.
I know, but it's so hard.
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
Lots of things rhyme with Rachel: bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.
Maypole.
All good.
Do you, maybe, have a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Didn't your dad used to call you "Pumpkin"?
Pumpkin?
But did he ever call you "Budolph"?
Hello, children.
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
-I showed them your picture.
Guys are throwing themselves at me and giving me stuff.
-Knicks tonight?
-Where are the seats?
Wherever!
I've got 20.
Will I like any of these guys?
You know, I'm going to...
Play the field a little bit more.
Guys are signing over their 401 Ks to me.
You work with robots?
One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.
He's nice, funny and a swimmer.
I like swimmers' bodies.
His dad made the magnetic strip on credit cards.
I like credit cards!
I'm not bad at this!
-What does he do?
-He works in fine foods.
-You have a fine foods division?
-It's a big company...
Now, wait a second.
You make food and robots?
No, the robots just work for them.
All right, I'm going to work.
Does anybody have a problem with that?
Yeah, lady.
I do!
I got a problem!
I'll give you a problem!
What will you do?
Fire me?
You bet your ass I'll fire you!
-See you later.
I should go.
I've got a date.
With who?
You know the girl who lives in Poughkeepsie?
Not her.
This is someone else.
I can't decide between the two.
The one from Poughkeepsie, though two hours away, is pretty... really smart and a lot of fun.
But this other girl, she lives right uptown.
She's just as pretty.
I guess she's smart.
She's not fun.
If she's no fun, why date her at all?
I want to give her a chance.
She lives so close.
And, at the end of the date, she said something that... if she was kidding, was very funny.
If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.
She's stupid and racist.
How was your first day at the restaurant?
Damn!
What happened to your fancy jacket?
They baked it.
I can't take this anymore.
-I'm going to fire you tonight.
-You got it.
You're still on fire there.
I think you got it!
Chandler, you have the best taste in men.
Like father, like son.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night!
This could, maybe, get serious.
I thought you weren't looking for serious.
Just a fling?
Well, you know, possibly.
You didn't tell him that, though, right?
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?
-You don't tell him that!
-Why not?
I'd be thrilled if some hot girl...
I see.
You telling him I want a fling and me putting out...
He's so going to get the wrong idea!
Joey, could you pass the cheese?
I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.
I thought it might be fun to try out a cool nickname.
Hey, Dragon!
Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
There's $300 in this one.
People get generous around the holidays.
And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Could the waiters listen to the specials?
There's Chilean sea bass with a mango relish...
Why is nobody writing these?
We can remember them.
Because you'll make up fake specials and make me cook them?
Sure, that too.
Forget the specials for a minute.
Here's the thing...
For the last two weeks I have... tried hard to create a positive atmosphere.
Can't hear you!
Positive atmosphere.
But I've had it up to here.
From now on, it is going to be my way... or the highway.
Hey, new guy.
I said, does anybody have a problem with that?
No, ma'am.
He has a name.
It's Dragon.
You want to know your name?
Check your hat.
We did the hat, right?
-What the hell just happened?
-I am so sorry.
I was going to do it.
But I was standing there with $327 in one hand... and $238 in the other.
And I was thinking... it's been a long time since I had... $327 plus $238!
We had a deal!
It's why you're here.
I've got to fire you!
And I got to pay rent!
How about you don't fire me.
Instead, I stay.
I gain their trust.
They'll listen to the nice things I say about you.
What nice things?
Nothing yet.
They hate you, and I want to fit in.
You know what, Pheebs?
I'm not Jewish so...
Ross doesn't decorate his tree with floss...
But he's not complaining.
Bad dream?
I wasn't sleeping.
What was Phoebe's song about?
It's the one with the cat.
I got to go.
I've got another date.
Did you pick one yet?
It turns out the one from uptown was making a joke.
It was a different joke.
It wasn't that funny.
So I'm still torn.
You don't like the one from uptown.
And you're exhausted from dating Poughkeepsie.
Just end them both!
Go to Poughkeepsie and break up with her.
Then break up with uptown.
By the time you get home, you're done!
I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
-Prague?
-So much you don't know.
Patrick just ended things with me.
Did you or didn't you tell him I wanted a serious relationship?
I did!
I absolutely did!
You idiot!
I'm sure you're right.
But why?
You don't tell a guy that you want a serious relationship.
Now you scared him away!
I am sorry.
You should never be allowed to talk to people!
I know, I know!
Now I'm right back where I started.
This sucks!
Being alone sucks!
You'll meet somebody.
You're a great catch!
When I told those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
You graduated magna cum laude, right?
It doesn't matter.
I got tickets to the Ranger game.
You want to come with me?
Cute guys in little shorts?
Actually, it's a hockey team.
Angry Canadians with no teeth.
That sounds fun too.
Have you ever been with a woman?
What is the matter with you?
There is no good time to ask that question.
The station is Poughkeepsie.
Poughkeepsie!
Wake up!
I need more swordfish.
-Can you get me more swordfish?
-I don't speak English.
-You just did.
-I don't know what to tell you.
Let me out, please.
Come on, I'm cold!
And covered in marinara sauce!
Let me out!
You found that handle, did you?
-It's not funny.
-Well, that's not true.
I'm a good person.
And I'm a good chef.
And I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me!
If you want me to quit this bad then...
Chef Geller?
You know that speech you made?
I got a problem with it!
-You do?
-You bet I do!
I just wasn't listening then, that's all.
If you want a problem, I'll give you a problem!
What are you going to do?
You bet I'll fire you!
Get out of my kitchen!
Get out!
Anybody else got a problem?
How about you, chuckles?
You think this is funny now?
What if I dance covered in sauce?
You think it's funny?
No, it's really good.
Take those salads to table four.
And you, get the swordfish!
And you!
Get a haircut!
Last stop, Montreal.
The stop is Montreal!
I bet myself that you had beautiful eyes.
Now that I see them, I win!
We're at my stop.
Would you like to have coffee?
Are we really in Montreal?
Yes, we are.
So coffee?
Coffee sounds great.
So you live in Montreal?
No, but it's only a two-hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
I should have thought about my wife and kids...
Before I talked back to Chef Geller.
It will be a lean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Enough!
Lean, lean, lean!
So this is a very special holiday song...
That I wrote for some very important people to me.
Went to the store Sat on Santa's lap.
Asked him to bring my friends All kinds of crap.
Said all you need is To write them a song.
Now you haven't heard it yet So don't try to sing along.
No, don't sing along.
Monica, Monica.
Have a happy Hannukah.
Saw Santa Claus.
He said hello to Ross.
And please tell Joey.
Christmas will be snowy.
And Rachel and Chandler.
Happy holidays, everybody!
Previously on Awkward...
You applied to college?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't tell anyone.
- We make a great team.
- Totally.
I'm glad we're hanging out because I like you, Jenna.
- Gabby's a really cool girl.
- Yeah, she is.
So are you.
Senior year was two-thirds over, and I still hadn't been accepted to college.
Thankfully, spring break was right around the corner, so I'd have plenty of quality time to wallow in self-pity.
Great news!
Ally rented a beach house in Rosarito, Mexico, for spring break, and the whole family is invited.
We are going spring breaking!
Spring break with Sadie: Pass.
Well, you can bring Tamara.
Ally said the house is huge, and Sadie's invited lots of friends to celebrate her acceptance to Columbia.
And I think I'm gonna have a tequila shot for breakfast.
That's great, Mom.
You and Sadie have a lot to celebrate, what, with you both going to college in the fall.
Yeah, can you just keep that stuff between us for now?
You still haven't told him?
I'm waiting for the right time.
Time for what?
Someone in this room got into Lockard College.
Oh, thank God.
I didn't want to say anything, but if you weren't accepted anywhere by spring break, I was really going to start to worry.
Not me.
Surprise!
When I was visiting campuses with Jenna this fall, I started thinking, "is it really too late for me?"
You applied to college without telling me?
Because if I didn't get in, there would be nothing to tell.
I got in.
So you're gonna commute or pledge a sorority, or what?
Aren't you a little old for all of that?
Yeah, Mom, if you want to party, why don't you just join the country club like all the other normal moms?
I do not want to party.
I want a career.
I think I might become a fixer.
A fixer?
That's a career?
Yes, you call a fixer when you're in real deep.
And they make all kinds of secret phone calls to the police and press...
Whoever.
Mom, that's not a career, that's a TV show.
Lace, you don't really have to go.
I mean, it's enough that you got in.
I am proud of you.
I'm going.
I just need to do a little more research.
I call the TV tonight.
Look at her, holding court like some newly engaged Kardashian.
Congrats, Sadie.
Yeah, congrats.
Right back at you, if you ever get accepted to anywhere, Hamilton.
I had tried to put my guilty conscience about my drunken hookup with Matty to bed, but I sensed a wake-up call was on its way.
Very cool, Sadie.
Lots to celebrate on spring break in Rosarito.
Thanks again for including me.
Ignore anything my slaggy Aunt Ally says.
She thinks she's using all my friends to mule Mexican pharmaceuticals across the border.
Hey, thanks again for all your help with Matty's party.
By the way, you left your tequila at his house.
Oh, no, I got it.
When?
It was definitely still there after you left.
I dropped it off to her.
I took it to her on...
- Saturday.
- Sunday.
- Sometime over the weekend.
Oh, well, thanks again for bringing it.
I definitely owe you one.
Oh, hey, Gabby.
Team meeting before class.
Got to run, see ya.
Okay, bye.
I am a horrible person.
What do you know?
You're a horrible person too.
I feel terrible lying to her.
Maybe we should just tell her about the hookup.
Why would we do that?
One thing I have learned is that secrets always have a way of coming out.
The important thing is that we stopped before it went too far.
It was just a kiss, not a big deal.
Boys, wait up.
I need something.
Aw, princess, keep up the sweet talk.
Your wish is your demand.
Listen, I can't afford Columbia, and I'm not going into debt for the next 40 years.
Is that a whiff of desperation I smell?
Mmm, desperation mixed with bitchery is such an intoxicating cocktail.
Good, so drink it up.
I'm a finalist for the Elsa Hax Scholarship, which will give me a free ride at Columbia.
They want a one-minute video showing who I really am, so I need your expert skills to make me look like the kind of sad, simpering sycophant they love to throw money at.
That really will require expertise.
And possibly CGI.
Great, I'll send you the deets.
Jake, I'm shooting my scholarship video with Theo and Cole later, and I want you there too.
- Sure.
I learned a lot about production making my music videos.
Oh, no, I don't need you for any of that.
Please, those music videos were pathetic.
I need an image consultant.
I want to come off as sweet and sincere, and you're like vanilla ice cream.
Boring, but everyone likes it, 'cause it's bland, benign, milquetoast...
I get it.
So will you help me?
Pretty please?
You have a girlfriend.
Yeah, I tried calling my biological dad.
His number was old.
I guess that's no surprise.
Like he'd have the same number for 18 years.
Well, maybe there's someplace you can get updated info.
Have you tried looking online?
No, there's gotta be a million Daniel Durands.
A million or...
136.
Jenna?
Oh, hey, Matty, I didn't know you were here.
Your girlfriend's name is Gabby, right?
Jeez, Mom, what are you, TMZ?
Well, she's at the front door.
I wanted to replace this since Matty totaled your other one.
That is so sweet.
You didn't have to do this.
She really didn't, because I felt guilty enough.
I have to say, I had doubts about this spring break trip.
I know Sadie and Matty go way back, but she kind of scares me.
We went to pre-school together, and my main memory of her was of burning insects with a magnifying glass.
Oh, she can still do that trick...
with her eyes.
Well, that's why I was so glad to hear you're going on the trip too.
It'll be nice to have a real friend there.
That's me.
Your real horrible friend.
You got to go.
Is she coming?
No, she left, but you got to go.
Relax, she doesn't know I'm here.
We still have time to search a little bit more.
I can't stand sneaking around.
Maybe you should be doing this with Gabby instead of me.
Jeez, relax.
Why do you have to make such a big deal out of everything?
If this comes out the wrong way or over spring break, it will be a big deal.
Promise me you'll talk to her.
Okay, yeah, whatever.
"I ended up living with my aunt, who is battling a chronic and debilitating illness"?
What's wrong with Ally?
Sounds like she's dying.
Her liver is.
She's a drunken slut.
You should just say that.
Speak your truth.
No, she's trying to win this thing.
If this were about being real, I'd tell these scholarship people how [Bleep] lucky they'd be to get me.
But the Elsa Hax Scholarship committee wants an ambassador of suckiness, so I'm gonna have to act it.
Ah, the basic bait-and-bitch switch.
So are we ready?
Let's get this [Bleep] rolling.
After my own financial reversal I came to see Palos Hills High School as a gilded cage of complacency and entitlement.
Unexpectedly, it was working on the food truck that...
Try not to say "food truck" like you're constipated.
How else am I supposed to say a word that makes me think of vile, stanky sausage?
Unexpectedly, it was working with people from different socioeconomic backgrounds that made me feel connected to everyone, not just those lucky enough to be born affluent.
This dual imperative of social justice and humility is what I hope will both buttress and inform my studies at Columbia.
Did we get it?
Because if I have to smile for one more minute, I am going to puke.
Yeah, I think so.
How long will this take to cut together?
It'll require painstaking work to knit together 60 seconds wiped of all bitchery and shade.
Great, I won't be needing your services any longer.
- Come back, Sadie.
- Oh, no, my dreams are ruined.
I want you to edit it.
why?
Because I got what I needed from those twisted twinks, and now I need a nice guy to do as he's told.
So don't [Bleep] it up, okay?
And thank you so much, Jake.
I had survived last night's close encounter and was determined to be a better friend to Gabby by limiting future encounters with Matty.
Jen.
Matty told me what went down after his party, and I totally understand.
We never even have to speak about it.
I knew you'd understand.
I mean, we didn't mean for anything to happen.
We were just both really drunk and sad, and...
Did you hook up with Jenna?
I thought you told her.
She said...
He told me you've been talking a lot because you're upset your mom got into college.
That is true, too.
I am such an idiot.
You two have fun on spring break together.
No, Gabby, wait, it's...
Thanks, Jenna.
Gabby.
Let's eat inside today.
There's too much trash out here.
What's with intimidation nation?
I thought you were tight with "Gab" and her crew.
Things have changed.
Oh, my God, what have you done now?
Why do you just assume it's my fault?
Because I've known you my whole life.
Matty and I sort of hooked up, briefly and barely, after his birthday party.
How could you be so déjà-stupid?
When are you gonna learn?
Old boyfriends are like chips: no double-dipping.
It's not like that.
It was a really intense night.
I'd just found out that my mom got into Lockard, and Matty...
More secrets?
It's not my secret, it's Matty's.
Okay, I know I can't keep a secret, but you still...
later.
I decided to finish my lunch in a familiar place without the judgmental stares.
Unfortunately, judgment was hard to outrun in high school.
Honesty had proved a dangerous policy, and I was suffering the consequences from Gabby and her crew.
Luckily, I had a guidance counselor available 24/7.
Spring break, woot-woot!
Did you hear?
Will and I are going to be meeting you in Mexico.
Yeah, I'm teaching Val how to scuba dive.
I can't believe she's never gone down and explored all the life just teeming in the ocean.
Well, what can I say?
I never wanted to go down until I met you.
Should I give you guys some private time?
Yeah, thanks.
I heard about your hookup.
That intimidation nation group scares me too.
It's understandable.
The only way you felt you could compete was by slutting it up.
It wasn't about that.
I was sad.
I just found out my mom got into college.
Well, bravo.
She's challenging herself, exploring uncharted waters.
Yeah, I understand Lacey's need to grow.
Will is pushing me to break free from my normal routine.
Speaking of, I need to be au courant on all things sexual for spring break.
Is it really possible to fit two whole...
Okay, not engaging.
Okay, good talk.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It takes two to tango, or sometimes three.
It's not all your fault.
It's all your fault.
Thanks to you, Matty isn't going on spring break.
I thought it was just Gabby who wasn't going.
Matty is one of the few people I actually care about in this school.
And now he's not going because of you and your overeager, rasty little beaver.
Next up, a video essay, submitted to us this very morning by Sadie Saxton, who's a finalist for the Elsa Hax Scholarship, which she hopes will pay her way to Columbia University.
Take note, all you juniors.
This is the kind of sucking up that gets you a free ride to the Ivy League.
My name is Sadie Saxton, and I'm a senior here at Palos Hills...
Can we do it again?
I said "Palos" like a cholo.
I've embraced my experiences beyond the gilded [Bleep]...
Cages.
I have to do that again.
Can you stop whispering?
Stop whispering, Mary-Kate and Trashley.
Shut the [Bleep] up.
Shut the [Bleep] up or get out.
If you ask for one more take, I will smash this camera into your brain.
Give that back to me...!
Get it together, [Bleep].
Shut the [Bleep] up!
I am going to flay and murder you...
very slowly.
That sounds hot.
But, sadly, can't take credit.
Jake is your man.
Someone spiked that vanilla shake with a little rum.
Rosati!
What the hell, Rosati?
That is not the video you showed me.
That better not be the video that went to Columbia.
Aw, you don't like it?
I thought the point was to capture the real you.
This is not a joke, you ass.
How about instead of the word "ass,"
you substitute "one of my oldest friends, who's always had my back."
You didn't send it.
I knew you it.
You are too...
Nice?
We're all used to you.
You exhale so much snark on a daily basis, you might actually be what's killing the bees.
I'm getting bored.
At Columbia, no one knows you yet.
You get a clean slate.
Oh, I get it.
You're trying to teach me a lesson.
Precious.
Really, I'm touched.
Let me think about this, 'cause maybe it'll convince me to change my ways and go off to college as a super nice girl.
No, you'll never be that, Sadie.
But maybe you're not as big a bitch as you want everyone to think you are.
No, I totally am.
Matty, wait.
Look, we made a mistake.
Yeah, I know, we should have told her.
Things have a way of coming out.
You have to communicate with her, Matty.
Yeah, I'm trying.
It's not that easy.
Well, you're able to with me, in your own sort of way.
Yeah, well, it's easier with you.
Well, I'm not the one you're trying to have a relationship with.
Look, we have a habit of falling into old patterns, and it keeps screwing us up.
- Yeah, I know.
And now the spring break thing.
Well, I'm not going, so it won't be a problem.
But you should go.
We should both be able to go.
It's our last spring break.
It would end my relationship with Gabby.
Because you haven't told her the truth.
Why don't you just tell her about the letter and that you're trying to find your real dad?
Hey, I told you I'm not ready, okay?
To share something with a girl you're willing to miss spring break over, or to find your real dad?
Matty, if you weren't ready, why did you come to me?
I have no clue.
I wish I hadn't.
Matty was impossible to decipher, so why did I keep trying to help him?
Shouldn't he have been going to his girlfriend for that?
Oh, right, he wasn't ready to communicate with her yet.
He had me for that.
Hey, let's go bikini shopping for spring break.
I don't even want to go on spring break anymore.
Is this about me going to college?
No, it's not about you.
Not everything is about you.
Hey, I don't like your tone.
Whether I go to college or not, I am still your mother.
Oh, I'm sorry if I get confused on when to treat you like a mother.
The way I see it, I'm the adult and you're the wild child.
Having tequila shots for breakfast?
I had one shot...
And an orange juice chaser.
It's like you're competing with me.
I mean, you have a better body than me.
You're more fun at parties than me.
You dress better.
I just offered to take you shopping.
Do you know how humiliating it is that you got into college and I didn't.
Congratulations, Mom.
You're better than me at everything!
It's okay, Kevin.
Jenna's right.
I am too old for college.
It is too late for me to start over.
Mom, wait.
I don't want her to not go because of me.
She's going.
I already mailed her tuition check.
Well, cancel it.
She doesn't want to go.
Yeah, that's what she said.
But look at all that she did.
Took the SATs, filled out applications, write essays, all knowing that she could be rejected.
Trust me, I know all about rejection.
I got two.
Jenna, you will get into college, and into the right place for you.
How can you be so sure?
Because I believe in you, like I believe in your mom.
And I know her better than anyone.
She wants this.
She's just scared.
She needs me to give her a little push to get over the hump.
That's what you do for the people you love.
My father's unscrambling of my mother's mixed signals got me thinking about Matty.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hmm?
Why is it so hard to be friends with exes?
I guess it's confusing for guys.
Our heads are wired one way, and our hearts are wired another, and our...
We shut down.
And we don't communicate what we really want.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to go tell your mother that she's going to college or she's grounded.
Suddenly, it made perfect sense why Matty had turned to me for help finding his bio dad instead of Gabby.
He was scared and needed a little push from the person who knew him better than anyone.
There was more than one fixer in this family.
Your mom let me in.
I found your biological father.
Turns out that eight of the Daniels were actually Danielles.
So then I narrowed it down by race and age, took a gamble that he still lived on the west coast and wasn't incarcerated, and narrowed it down to three very real possibilities.
And they're all on Facebook.
So the first one is Professor Durand.
Ph.D.
at Oregon.
Smart gene pool.
Second is Danny D.
from Bakersfield, although I can't really picture your father having a unibrow.
And then there's this guy.
He owns a beach rentals place and is also a paddle board instructor.
And get this, his place is right next to the border.
It's, like, an hour from Ally's beach house.
Maybe you're meant to go on spring break.
Maybe it's destiny.
I did not ask you to do this.
Now that you have the information, you can decide what you want to do with it when you're ready.
It's your mother's personal statement for her college app.
Let me guess, her dreams of fixing the world?
Sort of.
"Some people want to go to college so they can change the world.
"I just want to change me.
"There are a lot of things I would have done differently in my life if I had the chance.
"Most people would say that my daughter was a mistake.
"No one actually intends to get pregnant at 16.
"But that's not the way I see it.
"My daughter definitely altered the trajectory of my life.
"But I have never regretted it.
"I considered it a privilege to care for her and, yes, to be honest, "to oftentimes grow up with her.
"Hell, maybe she grew up faster than I did.
"She is so smart and so mature that sometimes she intimidates me, "but more often, she inspires me.
"Maybe that's my real goal when in trying to get into college, "to make my daughter as proud of me as I am of her, to live up to being Jenna Hamilton's mother."
Does that mean you're okay with col...
No, but at some point I will be.
Okay, got it.
And I knew I would.
I was surprising myself with my resilience...
and my optimism.
I even had a feeling things were gonna work out with Matty.
Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I made contact with my biological dad.
And I think I'm gonna meet him on spring break.
I'm sorry if I've been acting like a real jerk.
The truth is, I...
am a little scared to meet this guy.
I'd really like for you to be there with me.
Next on Awkward...
We're on spring break, people!
This is our last spring break together.
So let's really max it out.
We brought the best party favor ever.
Both: We're big in Japan!
Our video has like 12 million hits.
Goodbye, Palos Hills.
Hello, New York City.
Pretty soon it will all have been just a bad dream.
I should have known, once again, I was going to be left out in the cold.
My name is Mary Alice Young.
In this morning's paper, you may come across an article about the unusual day I had last week.
Normally, there's never anything newsworthy about my life, but that all changed last Thursday.
Of course, everything seemed quite normal at first.
I made breakfast for my family.
I performed my chores.
I completed my projects.
I ran my errands.
In truth, I spent the day as I spent every other day, quietly polishing the routine of my life until it gleamed with perfection.
That's why it was so astonishing when I decided to go to my hallway closet and retrieve a revolver that had never been used.
My body was discovered by my neighbor, Mrs.
Martha Huber, who'd been startled by a strange popping sound.
Her curiosity aroused, Huber tried to think of a reason for dropping in on me unannounced.
After some initial hesitation, she decided to return the blender she had borrowed from me six months before.
It's my neeighbor.
I think shee's beeeen shot.
Theeree's blood eeveerywheeree.
Yees, you'vee got to seend an ambulancee.
You'vee got to seend onee right now.
And, for a moment, Mrs.
Huber stood motionless in her kitchen, grief-stricken by this senseless tragedy.
But only for a moment.
If there was one thing Mrs.
Huber was known for, it was her ability to look on the bright side.
I was laid to rest on a Monday.
After the funeral, all the residents of Wisteria Lane came to pay their respects.
And, as people do in these situations, they brought food.
Lynette Scavo brought fried chicken.
Lynette had a great family recipe for fried chicken.
She didn't cook much while moving up the corporate ladder.
She didn't have the time.
But when her doctor announced she was pregnant, her husband Tom had an idea.
"Why not quit yourjob?"
"Kids do better with stay-at-home moms.
It would be so much less stressful."
But this was not the case.
In fact, Lynette's life had become so hectic she was now forced to get her chicken from the fast-food restaurant.
Lynette would've appreciated the irony if she'd thought about it.
But she didn't have the time.
- Stop it, stop it, stop it.
- But, Mom.
You aree going to beehavee today.
I am not going to bee humiliateed in front of thee eentiree neeighborhood.
And, just so you know how seerious I am...
- Santa's ceell-phonee numbeer.
How did you geet that?
I know someeonee who knows someeonee who knows an eelf.
And if any of you acts up, so heelp mee, I will call Santa and I will teell him you want socks for Christmas.
Aree you willing to risk that?
OK.
Leet's geet this oveer with.
Gabrielle Solis who lives down the block brought a spicy paella.
Since her modeling days in New York, Gabrielle had developed a taste for rich food...
and rich men.
Carlos, who worked in mergers and acquisitions, proposed on their third date.
Gabrielle was touched when tears welled up in his eyes.
But she soon discovered this happened every time Carlos closed a big deal.
Gabrielle liked her paella piping hot.
However, her relationship with her husband was considerably cooler.
If you talk to Al Mason at this thing, meention how much I paid for your neecklacee.
Why not pin thee reeceeipt to my cheest?
Hee leet mee know what hee paid for his wifee's conveertiblee.
- Just work it in.
- Theeree's no way I can.
At thee Donahuee party eeveeryonee was talking mutual funds.
You meentioneed you sleept with half thee Yankeeee outfieeld.
It camee up in thee conteext of thee conveersation.
Peeoplee aree staring.
Keeeep your voicee down.
Absoluteely.
Wee wouldn't want theem to think wee'ree not happy.
Bree Van De Kamp, who lives next door, brought baskets of muffins she baked from scratch.
Bree was known for her cooking.
And for making her own clothes.
And for doing her own gardening.
And for re-upholstering her own furniture.
Yes, Bree's many talents were known throughout the neighborhood.
Everyone on Wisteria Lane thought of Bree as the perfect wife and mother.
Everyone, that is, except her own family.
Paul.
Zachary.
- Heello, Mrs.
Van Dee Kamp.
- You shouldn't havee.
It was no troublee.
Thee baskeet with thee reed ribbon is for your gueests.
Thee onee with thee bluee ribbon is just for you and Zachary.
It's got rolls, muffins, breeakfast typee things.
Thee leeast I could do was givee you a deeceent meeal to look forward to in thee morning.
I know you'ree out of your minds with grieef.
Yees, wee aree.
I will neeeed thee baskeets back oncee you'ree donee.
Of coursee.
Susan Mayer, who lives across the street, brought macaroni and cheese.
Her husband, Karl, always teased her about her macaroni, saying it was the only thing she knew how to cook and she rarely made it well.
It was too salty the night she and Karl moved into their house.
It was too watery the night she found lipstick on Karl's shirt.
She burned it the night Karl told her he was leaving her for his secretary.
A year had passed since the divorce.
Susan had started to think how nice it would be to have a man in her life.
Even one who would make fun of her cooking.
Mom, why would someeonee kill theemseelvees?

I said, "What do most womeen leead?
Livees of noisy fulfillmeent?"
- Good for you.
- Did hee havee to bang his seecreetary?
I had that woman to brunch.
An eereect peenis doeesn't havee a conscieencee.
Eveen thee limp onees areen't that eethical.
This is why I joineed thee NRA.
Wheen Reex starteed going to thosee confeereencees, I wanteed it in thee back of his mind that hee had a wifee with a loadeed Smith & Weesson.
Lynniee, Tom's always away.
Do you eeveer worry hee might...?

So, Susan, is hee gonna stop seeeeing that woman?

What probleems could shee havee had?
Shee was heealthy, had a greeat homee, a nicee family.
Heer lifee was...
Our lifee.
If Mary Alicee was having a crisis, wee'd havee known.
Shee livees 50 feeeet away, for God sakees.

Movee it.

Paul, wee havee to leeavee now.
Oncee again, I am so sorry for your loss.
Lynette shouldn't have been so concerned about my husband.
He had other things on his mind.
Things below the surface.
The morning after my funeral, my friends and neighbors quietly went back to their busy, busy lives.
While some did their cooking... and some did their cleaning... and some did their yoga... others... did their homework.
- Hi...
I'm Juliee.
I kickeed my ball into your backyard.
Oh, OK.
Weell, leet's go round and geet it.
His wifee dieed a yeear ago.
In LA theeree weeree too many meemoriees.
Hee's reenting for tax purposees, but hopees to buy soon.

- I saw you flirting.
Now you know hee's singlee, you can ask him out.
Juliee, I likee Mr.

I don't know if I'm reeady to datee yeet.
You neeeed to geet back out theeree.
How long has it beeeen sincee you'vee had seex?
- Aree you mad I askeed you that?
- No, I'm trying to reemeembeer.
I don't want to talk to you about my lovee lifee.
I wouldn't havee said anything.
Just...
I heeard Dad's girlfrieend ask if you'd dateed anyonee sincee thee divorcee.
And Dad said hee doubteed it.
And theen theey both laugheed.
Heey, Susan.
Hi, Mikee.
I brought you a housee-warming gift.
I should'vee brought someething by eearlieer.
- Actually, you'ree thee first to stop by.
- Reeally?
- Susan knew she was lucky.
- Weell...
An eligible bachelor had moved on to Wisteria Lane and she was the first to find out.
She also knew that good news...
- Heello theeree.
Edie Britt was the most predatory divorcée in a five-block radius.
Her conquests were numerous.
Varied.
And legendary.
Wh...
Hi, Susan.
I hopee I'm not inteerrupting.
You must bee Mikee Deelfino.
Hi, I'm Ediee...
Britt.
I livee oveer theeree.

Susan had met the enemy.
And she was a slut.

Weell, thanks, Ediee.
greeat.
I'd invitee you in, but I was in thee middlee of someething.
- I'm latee for an appointmeent.
- I just wanteed to say hi.
And just like that, the race for Mike Delfino had begun.
For a moment, Susan wondered if her rivalry with Edie would remain friendly.
Oh, Mikee, I heeard you'ree a plumbeer.
But she was reminded that when it came to men...
Could you stop by lateer and takee a look at my pipees?
Women don't fight fair.
Byee, Susan.
- You can't ordeer mee around.
- Gabrieellee.
I'm not going.
Tanaka eexpeects eeveeryonee to bring theeir wivees.
Eveery timee I'm around that man, hee triees to grab my ass.
I madee oveer 200,000 doing busineess with him last yeear.
If hee wants to grab your ass, leet him.

Solis, you scareed mee.
Why is that bush theeree?
You weeree supposeed to dig it up.

Finee, I'll go.
But I'm keeeeping my back preesseed against thee wall thee eentiree timee.
Seeee, now this is what a marriagee is all about.
Compromisee.

You know, Mrs.
Solis, I reeally likee it wheen wee hook up, but, um, you know, I got to geet my work donee and...
I can't afford to losee this job.
This tablee was hand-carveed.
Carlos had it importeed from Italy.
It cost him $23,000.
You want to do it on thee tablee this timee?
Why can't wee eeveer havee normal soup?
Danieellee, theeree is nothing abnormal about basil puréee.
Oncee, can wee havee a soup peeoplee havee heeard of?

- Your fatheer can't eeat onions.
Hee's deeathly alleergic.
And I won't eeveen dignify your navy beean suggeestion.
So, how's thee osso buco?
- It's OK.
- It's OK?
I speent threeee hours cooking this meeal.
How do you think it feeeels wheen you say, "It's OK" in that sulleen tonee?
Who askeed you to speend threeee hours on dinneer?
Excusee mee?

You'ree thee onee acting likee shee's running for Mayor of Steepford.
Reex...
seeeeing that you'ree thee heead of this houseehold, I'd appreeciatee you saying someething.
Pass thee salt?
Three days after my funeral, Lynette replaced her grief with a much more useful emotion.
Indignation.
Tom, this is my fifth meessagee and you still haveen't calleed mee back.
You must bee having a lot of fun on your busineess trip.

Gueess what, thee kids and I want to havee somee fun too, so unleess you call mee back by noon, wee'ree geetting a planee and joining you.

Yeeah, weell.
So how's domeestic lifee?
Don't you just lovee beeing a mom?
And there it was.
The question that Lynette always dreaded.
Weell, to bee honeest...
For those who asked it, only one answer was acceptable.
So Lynette responded as she always did.
She lied.
It's thee beest job I'vee eeveer had.
- You know what I don't geet?
Why you marrieed Mr.
Weell, hee promiseed to givee mee eeveerything I'vee eeveer wanteed.

Why aree wee doing this?
Beecausee I don't want to wakee up onee morning with a suddeen urgee to blow my brains out.
- Heey, can I havee a drag?

You aree much too young to smokee.
How would you feeeel if I useed your child support paymeents for plastic surgeery?
Stop beeing neervous.
You'ree just asking him to dinneer.
No big deeal.
You'ree right.
So is that your projeect for school?

- Oh, heello, Mrs.
Hubeer.
Wee didn't geet a chancee to talk at Mary Alicee's wakee.
How aree you doing?
Bree longed to share the truth about her husband's painful betrayal.
But sadly for Bree, admitting defeat was not an option.
Greeat.
Eveerything is just greeat.
I got you thee honeey mustard dreessing.
Thee ranch lookeed a littlee bit suspeect.
Aree wee gonna talk about what I said?
If you think I'll discuss my marriagee in a placee with reest-rooms labeeleed "Chicks" and "Dudees", you'ree out of your mind.
- What's in this?
- What do you meean?
It's salad.
- With...
with onions.
- You put onions in my salad.
- No I didn't.
Oh, wait.
The sound that awakened my son was something he'd heard only once before.
Many years ago when he was quite young.
But he recognized it instantly.
It was the sound of a family secret.
Seven days after my funeral, life on Wisteria Lane finally returned to normal.
Which, for some of my friends, was unfortunate.
- Mommy, Mommy!
- Now what?
- Daddy's homee!
Comee on!
Heey, is anybody homee?
- Heey!
I wasn't eexpeecting you for a weeeek.
I havee to go back to 'Frisco in thee morning.
But I got your call.
You soundeed frazzleed.
- It's beeeen a littlee rough.

Oh, God, preeseents.

Oh, baby.
I was having troublee with sweelling.

Leet's risk it.
- Leet's risk it?
- I can't beelieevee you trieed to kill mee.

I'm sick of thee bizarree way your hair doeesn't movee.
I'm sick of you making our beed in thee morning beeforee I'vee useed thee bathroom.
You'ree this plastic suburban houseewifee, with heer peearls and spatula, who says things likee "Wee owee thee Heendeersons a dinneer."
Wheeree's thee woman I feell in lovee with...
Who useed to burn thee toast and drink milk out of thee carton?
And laugh.
I neeeed heer.
Not this cold, peerfeect thing you'vee beecomee.
Theesee neeeed wateer.
Bree sobbed quietly in the restroom for five minutes, but her husband never knew.
Because when Bree finally emerged... she was perfect.
- I found my eearrings.
Wee can go now.
- Was John heeree today?
Weell, yeeah.
Thee lawn hasn't beeeen moweed.
I'vee had it.
Wee'ree geetting a reeal gardeeneer.

You seeee that man just walkeed away?
Can you makee suree hee has a drink in his hand all night long?
Yees, ma'am.
Mm.
- Susan?
Susan!
Hubeer, how aree you doing?
Not too weell, I'm afraid.
I'm trying to find someething to soothee my stomach.
- It's upseet?
I had thee worst macaroni and cheeeesee at thee wakee.
It's beeeen running through mee.
And I neeeed to bee at my beest.
Ediee Britt's son is speending thee night.
Hee's speending thee night?
Ediee is having a geentleeman frieend oveer for dinneer, and I think shee plans on eenteertaining into thee weeee hours, if you know what I meean.
Oh, heeree's somee antacid.
Havee you eeveer trieed this?
I can't beelieevee it.
This can't bee happeening.
Mikee can't likee Ediee beetteer than mee.
You don't know what's going on.
Maybee theey'ree just having dinneer.
Theey'ree doing it.
Ediee?
Heello?
Anybody homee?
I neeeed to borrow sugar.
Oh, my God!
Oh, yees!
Givee it to mee!
And just like that, the possibility Susan had clung to, the maybe of Mike Delfino, was gone forever.
And despite the precariousness of her situation, Susan took a moment to mourn her loss.
It didn't take Susan long to realize, this was just not her night.
Is someebody out theeree?
- Oh, my God!
That's smokee!
Shee leeft candlees unatteendeed in thee deen.
Parameedic said shee was lucky.
Shee could'vee beeeen killeed.
Shee ran out with nothing on.
- Shee was having seex with somee guy.
- What happeeneed to him?
Hee got smokee inhalation.
Hee's at thee hospital.
Susan, aree you all right?
You look awful.
I'm finee.
I just, uh, feeeel reeally bad for Ediee.
Oh, honeey, don't worry about Ediee.
Shee's a strong lady.
Shee'll geet through this.
Shee'll find a way to survivee.
Wee all do.
- Wow!

And suddenly there he was.
Like a phoenix rising from the ashes.
I thought you weeree...
uh...
Wheeree weeree you?
I just got back from thee moviees.
Ediee had a firee, huh?
Yeeah, but shee's finee now.
Eveerything's finee now.
And just like that, Susan was happy.
Life was suddenly full of...
possibilities.
Not to mention a few unexpected surprises.
- It's mee.
- Have anything yet?
- No, nothing yeet.
But don't worry.
I'm deefiniteely geetting closeer.
I brought somee champagnee.
I thought wee should havee a toast.
The next day my friends came together to pack away my clothes, my personal belongings and what was left of my life.
All right, ladiees, lift 'eem up.
To Mary Alicee, a good frieend and neeighbor.
Wheereeveer you aree, wee hopee you'vee found peeacee.

Leet's geet this show on thee road.
You guys, cheeck out Mary Alicee's clothees.
Sizee eeight?
Shee always told mee shee was a sizee six.
- Wee found thee skeeleeton in heer closeet.
- Not quite, Gabrielle, not quite.
- A leetteer addreesseed to Mary Alicee.
How ironic.
To have something I tried so desperately to keep secret, treated so casually.
- What aree you doing?
That's privatee.
- It's opeen.
- What doees this meean?
Cheeck out thee postmark.
Shee got it thee day shee dieed.
Do you think this is why shee...?
I'm so sorry, girls.
I never wanted you to be burdened with this.
Oh, Mary Alicee, what did you do?
My name is Mary Alice Young.
about the unusual day I had last week.
but that all changed last Thursday.
Of course, everything seemed quite normal at first.
I made breakfast for my family.
I performed my chores.
I completed my projects.
I ran my errands.
quietly polishing the routine of my life until it gleamed with perfection.
and retrieve a revolver that had never been used.
who'd been startled by a strange popping sound.
Huber tried to think of a reason for dropping in on me unannounced.
she decided to return the blender she had borrowed from me six months before.
It's my neighbor.
I think she's been shot.
There's blood everywhere.
Yes, you've got to send an ambulance.
You've got to send one right now.
grief-stricken by this senseless tragedy.
But only for a moment.
it was her ability to look on the bright side.
I was laid to rest on a Monday.
came to pay their respects.
And, as people do in these situations, they brought food.
Lynette Scavo brought fried chicken.
Lynette had a great family recipe for fried chicken.
She didn't cook much while moving up the corporate ladder.
She didn't have the time.
But when her doctor announced she was pregnant, her husband Tom had an idea.
"It would be so much less stressful.
But this was not the case.
she was now forced to get her chicken from the fast-food restaurant.
Lynette would've appreciated the irony if she'd thought about it.
But she didn't have the time.
You are going to behave today.
I am not going to be humiliated in front of the entire neighborhood.
And, just so you know how serious I am...
- Santa's cell-phone number.
How did you get that?
I know someone who knows someone who knows an elf.
And if any of you acts up, so help me, I will call Santa and I will tell him you want socks for Christmas.
Are you willing to risk that?
Let's get this over with.
Gabrielle Solis who lives down the block brought a spicy paella.
for rich food...
and rich men.
proposed on their third date.
Gabrielle was touched when tears welled up in his eyes.
But she soon discovered this happened every time Carlos closed a big deal.
Gabrielle liked her paella piping hot.
However, her relationship with her husband was considerably cooler.
mention how much I paid for your necklace.
Why not pin the receipt to my chest?
He let me know what he paid for his wife's convertible.
- There's no way I can.
At the Donahue party everyone was talking mutual funds.
You mentioned you slept with half the Yankee outfield.
It came up in the context of the conversation.
People are staring.
Keep your voice down.
We wouldn't want them to think we're not happy.
brought baskets of muffins she baked from scratch.
And for making her own clothes.
And for doing her own gardening.
And for re-upholstering her own furniture.
Yes, Bree's many talents were known throughout the neighborhood.
Everyone on Wisteria Lane thought of Bree as the perfect wife and mother.
Everyone, that is, except her own family.
- Hello, Mrs.
Van De Kamp.
- You shouldn't have.
It was no trouble.
The basket with the red ribbon is for your guests.
The one with the blue ribbon is just for you and Zachary.
It's got rolls, muffins, breakfast type things.
The least I could do was give you a decent meal to look forward to in the morning.
I know you're out of your minds with grief.
I will need the baskets back once you're done.
brought macaroni and cheese.
saying it was the only thing she knew how to cook and she rarely made it well.
It was too salty the night she and Karl moved into their house.
It was too watery the night she found lipstick on Karl's shirt.
She burned it the night Karl told her he was leaving her for his secretary.
A year had passed since the divorce.
Susan had started to think how nice it would be to have a man in her life.
Even one who would make fun of her cooking.
Mom, why would someone kill themselves?
Well, sometimes people are so unhappy, they think that's the only way to solve their problems.
Young always seemed happy.
Sometimes people pretend to be one way, when they're totally different inside.
Like how Dad's girlfriend always says nice things, but we know she's a bitch.
I don't like that word, Julie.
But, yeah, that's a great example.
You're welcome.
What's going on?
- Hey.
So what did Karl say when you confronted him?
You'll love this, he said, "It doesn't mean anything.
It was just sex."
Ah, yes, page one of the philanderer's handbook.
Then he got this Zen look on his face and said, "You know, most men live lives of quiet desperation."
- Tell me you punched him.
"What do most women lead?
Lives of noisy fulfillment?"
- Did he have to bang his secretary?
An erect penis doesn't have a conscience.
Even the limp ones aren't that ethical.
This is why I joined the NRA.
When Rex started going to those conferences, I wanted it in the back of his mind that he had a wife with a loaded Smith & Wesson.
Lynnie, Tom's always away.
Do you ever worry he might?
He's gotten me pregnant three times in four years.
I wish he was having sex with someone else.
So, Susan, is he gonna stop seeing that woman?
I just don't know how I'm gonna survive this.
Listen to me.
We all have moments of desperation.
If we can face them head-on, that's when we find out how strong we really are.
I was just saying Paul wants us to go over on Friday.
He needs us to help pack up Mary Alice's things.
He can't face doing it by himself.
That's fine.
- Are you OK?
If Mary Alice was having problems, she should've let us help her.
What problems could she have had?
She was healthy, had a great home, a nice family.
Her life was...
Our life.
If Mary Alice was having a crisis, we'd have known.
She lives 50 feet away, for God sakes.
Gabby, the woman killed herself.
Something must've been going on.
- I wouldn't eat that if I were you.
I made it.
Hey, hey, do you have a death wish?
No, I just don't believe that anybody can screw up macaroni and cheese.
How did you?
It tastes like it's burnt and undercooked.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
Here you go.
I'm Mike Delfino.
I just started renting the Sims' house next door.
Susan Mayer.
I live across the street.
Huber told me about you.
Said you illustrate children's books.
Yeah, I'm very big with the under-five set.
- [He laughs] - What do you do?
Plumber.
So if you ever have a clog... or something.
Now that everybody's seen that I brought something, [Baby squeals]
- Ow.
Ease up, you little vampire.
Lynette, I've been looking all over for you.
Are you aware of what your sons are doing?
We are at a wake.
- You said we could go in the pool.
- I said you could go by the pool.
Do you have your swimsuits on?
Yeah, we put 'em on ourselves before we left.
You three planned this?
Get out.
I am your mother.
You have to do what I say.
We want to swim and you can't stop us!
- Get out.
Think I won't get in this pool and just grab you?
Get over here.
All right, give me your arm.
Move it.
Paul, we have to leave now.
Once again, I am so sorry for your loss.
Lynette shouldn't have been so concerned about my husband.
Things below the surface.
to their busy, busy lives.
While some did their cooking...
and some did their cleaning...
and some did their yoga...
others...
did their homework.
I'm Julie.
I kicked my ball into your backyard.
Well, let's go round and get it.
His wife died a year ago.
In LA there were too many memories.
He's renting for tax purposes, but hopes to buy soon.
- I can't believe you went over there.
Now you know he's single, you can ask him out.
Julie, I like Mr.
Delfino, I do.
I don't know if I'm ready to date yet.
You need to get back out there.
How long has it been since you've had sex?
- Are you mad I asked you that?
- No, I'm trying to remember.
I don't want to talk to you about my love life.
I wouldn't have said anything.
I heard Dad's girlfriend ask if you'd dated anyone since the divorce.
And Dad said he doubted it.
And then they both laughed.
Hey, Susan.
Hi, Mike.
I brought you a house-warming gift.
I should've brought something by earlier.
- Actually, you're the first to stop by.
- "Susan knew she was lucky."
- Well...
and she was the first to find out.
She also knew that good news...
- Hello there.
travels quickly."
Edie Britt was the most predatory divorcée in a five-block radius.
Her conquests were numerous.
Varied.
And legendary.
Wh...
I hope I'm not interrupting.
You must be Mike Delfino.
Hi, I'm Edie...
I live over there.
Welcome to Wisteria Lane.
And she was a slut.
Sausage "puttanesca."
It's just something I threw together.
Well, thanks, Edie.
great.
I'd invite you in, but I was in the middle of something.
- I'm late for an appointment.
- I just wanted to say hi.
And just like that, the race for Mike Delfino had begun.
would remain friendly.
Oh, Mike, I heard you're a plumber.
But she was reminded that when it came to men...
Could you stop by later and take a look at my pipes?
Women don't fight fair."
- Sure.
Bye, Susan.
- You can't order me around.
- Gabrielle.
Tanaka expects everyone to bring their wives.
Every time I'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass.
I made over 200,000 doing business with him last year.
If he wants to grab your ass, let him.
Solis, you scared me.
Why is that bush there?
You were supposed to dig it up.
- I didn't have time.
- I don't want excuses.
Just take care of it.
I really hate the way you talk to me.
And I hate that I spent $15,000 on your diamond necklace you couldn't live without.
But I'm learning to deal with it.
So can I tell Tanaka we'll be there tomorrow?
John, we have bandages top shelf in the kitchen.
Fine, I'll go.
But I'm keeping my back pressed against the wall the entire time.
See, now this is what a marriage is all about.
Compromise.
- Is your finger OK?
- Yeah, it's just a small cut.
Let me see.
Solis, I really like it when we hook up, but, um, you know, I got to get my work done and...
I can't afford to lose this job.
This table was hand-carved.
Carlos had it imported from Italy.
You want to do it on the table this time?
Why can't we ever have normal soup?
Danielle, there is nothing abnormal about basil purée.
Once, can we have a soup people have heard of?
- Like French onion or navy bean?
- Your father can't eat onions.
He's deathly allergic.
And I won't even dignify your navy bean suggestion.
So, how's the osso buco?
I spent three hours cooking this meal.
How do you think it feels when you say, "It's OK" in that sullen tone?
Who asked you to spend three hours on dinner?
Tim Harper's mom gets home from work, pops open a can of pork and beans, and they're eating, everyone's happy.
- You'd rather I served pork and beans?
- Apologize now, I beg.
I'm saying do you always have to serve cuisine?
Can't we just have food?
- Are you doing drugs?
Change in behavior is a warning sign and you have been as fresh as paint for the last six months.
It explains why you're always in the bathroom.
- That is not what he's doing.
Mom, I'm not the one with the problem here.
You're the one acting like she's running for Mayor of Stepford.
Rex...
seeing that you're the head of this household, I'd appreciate you saying something.
Pass the salt?
Lynette replaced her grief with a much more useful emotion.
Indignation.
Tom, this is my fifth message and you still haven't called me back.
You must be having a lot of fun on your business trip.
I can only imagine.
Guess what, the kids and I want to have some fun too, so unless you call me back by noon, we're getting a plane and joining you.
Mommy's threatening Daddy.
- Where are your brothers?
- Noodles, my favorite.
- Lynette Scavo?
- [Under her breath] Crap.
Natalie Klein.
I don't believe it.
- Lynette.
How long has it been?
- Years.
How's the firm?
Everyone misses you.
We all say, if you hadn't quit you'd be running the place by now.
Yeah, well.
So how's domestic life?
Don't you just love being a mom?
The question that Lynette always dreaded.
Well, to be honest...
For those who asked it, only one answer was acceptable.
She lied.
It's the best job I've ever had.
- You know what I don't get?
Why you married Mr.
Well, he promised to give me everything I've ever wanted.
- And did he?
Then why aren't you happy?
Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.
So do you love him?
So then why are we here?
Why are we doing this?
Because I don't want to wake up one morning with a sudden urge to blow my brains out.
- Hey, can I have a drag?
- Absolutely not.
You are much too young to smoke.
How would you feel if I used your child support payments for plastic surgery?
Stop being nervous.
You're just asking him to dinner.
No big deal.
So is that your project for school?
In fifth grade I made the White House out of sugar cubes.
Before Mike figures out he can do better.
Tell me again why I fought for custody of you.
- You were using me to hurt Dad.
- Hey, Susan.
- Are you busy?
Well, I...
I just, uh, was wondering if...
If there was any chance that you, uh...
I just wanted to ask if...
- Edie.
- Hey, there, Susan.
- What are you?
And I made too much so I thought I'd bring some over to Mike.
- Susan was gonna ask me something.
- I have a clog.
- Excuse me?
- And you're a plumber, right?
- The clog's in the pipe.
- Yeah, that's usually where they are.
- Well, I've got one.
Let me get my tools.
You want to come over now?
You have company.
Just give me two minutes.
I'll be right over.
- Stuff the hair down.
- I stuffed it.
- It's not enough to clog it.
- Here.
Put in this peanut butter.
- And these olives.
How am I gonna stop up the sink?
Well, here's your problem.
Somebody stuffed a bunch of Popsicle sticks down here.
I've told Julie a million times not to play in the kitchen.
I'll go put in your orders and I'll be back with your plates for the salad bar.
Andrew, Danielle, napkins.
They have video games.
Can we go play until our food gets here?
- This is family time.
- Go ahead and play.
I know you think I'm angry about coming here, but I'm not.
The kids wanted a change of pace, something fun.
They'll want something healthier tomorrow, though.
- I'm thinking chicken saltimbocca.
- I want a divorce.
I just can't live in this... this detergent commercial anymore.
The salad bar's there.
Help yourself.
Um, I think I'll go get your salad for you.
- Bree Van De Kamp.
- Oh, hello, Mrs.
Huber.
We didn't get a chance to talk at Mary Alice's wake.
How are you doing?
Bree longed to share the truth about her husband's painful betrayal.
But sadly for Bree, admitting defeat was not an option.
Everything is just great.
I got you the honey mustard dressing.
The ranch looked a little bit suspect.
Are we gonna talk about what I said?
If you think I'll discuss my marriage in a place with rest-rooms labeled "Chicks" and "Dudes", you're out of your mind.
The sound that awakened my son was something he'd heard only once before.
Many years ago when he was quite young.
But he recognized it instantly.
It was the sound of a family secret.
finally returned to normal.
Which, for some of my friends, was unfortunate.
- Daddy's home!
Hey, is anybody home?
- Hey!
I wasn't expecting you for a week.
I have to go back to 'Frisco in the morning.
You sounded frazzled.
- It's been a little rough.
Peaches.
Did you buy us any presents?
Oh, God, presents.
- Yeah!
But I'm not giving it to you unless you promise to go outside right now and practise throwing for 20 minutes.
Yeah!
Who's open?
Deeper.
You got to be kidding.
I'm exhausted.
I look terrible.
I'm covered in peaches.
I got to have you.
- Well, is it OK if I just lie here?
- Absolutely.
- I love you.
- I love you more...
I was having trouble with swelling.
The doctor took me off the pill.
What's the big deal?
Let's risk it.
- Let's risk it?
- I can't believe you tried to kill me.
- Yes, well, I feel badly about that.
Huber came over and I got distracted.
It was a mistake.
- Since when do you make mistakes?
- What does that mean?
It means I'm sick of you being so damn perfect all the time.
I'm sick of the bizarre way your hair doesn't move.
I'm sick of you making our bed in the morning before I've used the bathroom.
You're this plastic suburban housewife, with her pearls and spatula, who says things like "We owe the Hendersons a dinner."
Where's the woman I fell in love with...
Who used to burn the toast and drink milk out of the carton?
I need her.
Not this cold, perfect thing you've become.
These need water.
but her husband never knew.
Because when Bree finally emerged...
she was perfect.
- I found my earrings.
We can go now.
- Was John here today?
Well, yeah.
The lawn hasn't been mowed.
I've had it.
We're getting a real gardener.
- Are you deaf?
I just said he's not doing his job.
You just can't see the lawn has been mowed.
Feel this grass.
- I'm not feeling the grass.
Let's just get going.
Come on, we're late.
- Take care of it.
- Yes, sir.
There's Tanaka.
Time for me to go and do my dance.
Good luck, sweetheart.
You see that man just walked away?
Can you make sure he has a drink in his hand all night long?
Yes, ma'am.
Huber, how are you doing?
Not too well, I'm afraid.
I'm trying to find something to soothe my stomach.
- It's upset?
I had the worst macaroni and cheese at the wake.
It's been running through me.
And I need to be at my best.
Edie Britt's son is spending the night.
He's spending the night?
Edie is having a gentleman friend over for dinner, and I think she plans on entertaining into the wee hours, if you know what I mean.
Oh, here's some antacid.
Have you ever tried this?
This can't be happening.
Mike can't like Edie better than me.
Maybe they're just having dinner.
They're doing it.
Edie?
Anybody home?
I need to borrow sugar.
Oh, my God!
Oh, yes!
Give it to me!
the maybe of Mike Delfino, was gone forever.
Susan took a moment to mourn her loss.
It didn't take Susan long to realize, this was just not her night.
Is somebody out there?
- Oh, my God!
That's smoke!
She left candles unattended in the den.
Paramedic said she was lucky.
She could've been killed.
She ran out with nothing on.
- She was having sex with some guy.
- What happened to him?
He got smoke inhalation.
He's at the hospital.
Susan, are you all right?
I just, uh, feel really bad for Edie.
Oh, honey, don't worry about Edie.
She's a strong lady.
She'll get through this.
She'll find a way to survive.
We all do.
- Mike!
Like a phoenix rising from the ashes.
I thought you were...
I just got back from the movies.
Edie had a fire, huh?
Yeah, but she's fine now.
Everything's fine now.
And just like that, Susan was happy.
possibilities.
Not to mention a few unexpected surprises.
- "Hello."
- It's me.
- "Have anything yet?"
- No, nothing yet.
I'm definitely getting closer.
I brought some champagne.
I thought we should have a toast.
my personal belongings and what was left of my life.
All right, ladies, lift 'em up.
To Mary Alice, a good friend and neighbor.
Wherever you are, we hope you've found peace.
- To Mary Alice.
Let's get this show on the road.
You guys, check out Mary Alice's clothes.
Size eight?
She always told me she was a size six.
- We found the skeleton in her closet.
- "Not quite, Gabrielle, not quite."
- A letter addressed to Mary Alice.
How ironic.
To have something I tried so desperately to keep secret, treated so casually.
- What are you doing?
That's private.
- It's open.
- What does this mean?
Check out the postmark.
She got it the day she died.
Do you think this is why she?
I never wanted you to be burdened with this.
Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?
When you read this morning's paper, you may come across an article but that all changed last thursday.
In truth, I spent the day as I spent every other day --
My body was discovered by my neighbor mrs.
who had been startled by a strange popping sound.
Her curiosity aroused, mrs.
After some initial hesitation, she decided to return the blender she had borrowed from me six months before.
You've got to send an ambulance.
And for a moment, mrs.
Huber stood motionless in her kitchen, grief-stricken by this senseless tragedy...
If there was one thing mrs.
I was laid to rest on a monday.
After the funeral, all the residents of wisteria lane came to pay their respects.
Of course, she didn't cook much while she was moving up the corporate ladder.
But when her doctor announced Lynette was pregnant, her husband Tom had an idea.
"Why not quit your job?
In fact, Lynette's life had become so hectic, she was now forced to get her fried chicken from a fast-food restaurant.
Lynette would have appreciated the irony if she stopped to think about it, but she couldn't.
- Stop it !
- But, mom!
No, you are going to behave today.
And just so you know how serious I am...
what's that?
Santa's cell phone number.
How'd you get that?
I know someone who knows someone who knows an elf, and if any of you acts up, so help me, I will call Santa, You willing to risk that?
Gabrielle Solis, who lives down the block, brought a spicy paella.
Since her modeling days in New York, Gabrielle had developed a taste for rich food...
and rich men.
Carlos, who worked in mergersnd acquisitions, proposed on their third date.
Gabrielle was touched when tears welled up in his eyes, but she soon discovered this happened every time Carlos closed the big deal.
If you talk to Al Mason at this thing, I want you to casually mention how much I paid for your necklace.
He let me know how much he paid for his wife's new convertible.
Why don't I just pin the receipt to my chest?
Look, just work it into the conversation.
There's no way I can just work that in, Carlos.
At the Donoghue party, everyone was talking mutual funds, and you found a way to mention you slept with half the Yankee outfield.
I'm telling you, it came up in the context of the conversation.
Hey, people are starting to stare.
Can you keep your voice down, please?
Bree van de Kamp, who lives next door, brought baskets of muffins she baked from scratch.
Bree was known for her cooking, and for making her own clothes, and for doing her own gardening, and for reupholstering her own furniture.
Yes, Bree's many talents were known throughout the neighborhood, and everyone on Wisteria lane thought of Bree as the perfect wife and mother.
Hello, mrs.
Bree, you shouldn't have gone to all this trouble.
It was no trouble at all.
Now, the basket with the red ribbon is filled with desserts for your guests, but the one with the blue ribbon is just for you and Zachary.
It's got rolls, muffins, breakfast-type things.
Well, the least I could do is make sure you boys had a decent meal to look forward to in the morning.
Of course, I will need the baskets back once you're done.
Susan Mayer, who lives across the street, brought macaroni and cheese.
Her husband Carl always teased her about her macaroni, saying it was the only thing she knew how to cook, and she rarely made it well.
It was too salty the night she and Carl moved into their house.
It was too watery the night she found lipstick on Carl's shirt.
She burned it the night carl told her he was leaving her for his secretary.
Susan had started to think how nice it would be to have a man in her life, even one who would make fun of her cooking.
Mom...
why would someone kill themselves?
sometimes people are so unhappy, they think that's the only way they can solve their problems.
But mrs.
Yeah, sometimes people pretend to be one way on the outside when they're totally different on the inside.
Oh, you mean like how dad's girlfriend always smiling and says nice things, but deep down, you just know she's a bitch?
Hi, susan.
So, what did Carl say when you confronted him?
You'll love this.
He said...
"it doesn't mean anything.
Yeah, and then he got this zen look on his face, and he said, "you know, Susan, most men live lives of quiet desperation."
Please tell me you punched him.
No, I said, "really?
And what do most women lead lives of noisy fulfillment?"
Hmm.
Good for you.
I mean, of all people, did he have to bang his secretary?
I had that woman over for brunch.
It's like my grandmother always said -- an erect penis doesn't have a conscience.
This is half the reason I joined the NRA.
Well, when Rex started going to those medical conferences, I wanted it in the back of his mind that he had a loving wife at home...
Lynnie, Tom's always away on business.
Oh, please, the man's gotten me pregnant three times in four years.
So, Susan, is he going to stop seeing that woman?
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just don't know how I'm going to survive this.
But if we can face them head-on, that's when we find out just how strong we really are.
I was just saying Paul wants us to go over on friday.
He needs us to go through Mary Alice's closetand help pack up her things.
He said he can't face doing it by himself.
Are you okay?
If Mary Alice was having problems,she should have come to us.
She should have let us help her.
What kind of problems could she have had?
She was healthy, had a great home, a nice family.
- Her life was...
- Our life.
No, if Mary Alice was having some sort of crisis, we'd have known.
She lives 50 feet away, for god's sakes.
Something must have been going on.
I wouldn't eat that if I were you.
Hey, hey, do you -- do you have a death wish?
No, I just refuse to believe that anybody cans crew up macaroni and cheese.
Oh, my god.
How did you -- it tastes like it's burned and undercooked.
Ha ha.
I just started renting the simms house next door.
Oh, yeah, mrs.
Yeah, I'm very big with the under-5 set.
- What do you do?
- Plumber.
or something.
When we got here, you said we could go in the pool.
I said you could go by the pool.
Yeah, we put them under our clothes before we left.
We want to swim, and you can't stop us!
Get out, or I will get in this pool and just grab you.
Get -- get over here!
Get back --
Move it!
That's right!
Get over here!
He had other things on his mind -- things below the surface.
The morning after my funeral, my friends and neighbors quietly went back to their busy, busy lives.
and some did their cleaning...
and some did their yoga...
others did their homework.
I kicked my soccer ball into your backyard.
Oh, okay.
Well, let's go around and get it.
Stay.
He wanted to stay in L.A., but there were too many memories.
He's renting for tax purposes, but he hopes to buy a place real soon.
I can't believe you went over there.
Hey, I saw you both flirting at the wake.
You're obviously into each other.
Now that you know he's single, you can ask him out.
Julie, I like mr.
I just, uh, I don't even know if I'm ready to start dating yet.
Oh, you need to get back out there.
Are you mad that I asked you that?
No, I'm just trying to remember.
I don't want to talk to you about my love life anymore.
It weirds me out.
I heard dad's girlfriend ask if you'd dated anyone since the divorce, and dad said he doubted it.
- Susan.
- Hi, Mike.
I brought you a little housewarming gift.
I probably should have brought something by earlier, but...
actually, you're the first in the neighborhood to stop by.
Susan knews he was lucky.
An eligible bachelor had moved onto wisteria lane, and she was the first to find out, but she also knew that good news...
Travels quickly.
Edie Britt was the most predatory divorcée in a 5-block radius.
Her conquests were numerous...
varied...
and legendary.
Hi, I'm Edie.
Welcome to Wisteria lane.
Susan had met the enemy, and she was a slut.
Sausage putanesca.
It's just something I threw together.
That's great.
I'd invite you both in, but I was sort of in the middle of something.
For a moment, Susan wondered if her rivalry with Edie would remain friendly.
Oh, Mike.
I heard you're a plumber?
do you think you could stop by later tonight and take a look at my pipes?
- Women don't fight fair.
You can't order me around like I'm a child.
It's business.
I made over $200,000 doing business with him last year.
If he wants to grab your ass, you let him.
You scared me.
Why is that bush still there?
You were supposed to dig it up last week.
I didn't have time last week.
I don't want to hear your excuses.
And I really hate that I spend $15,000 on your diamond necklace that you couldn't live without, but I'm learning to deal with it.
So can I tell Tanaka we'll be there tomorrow night?
John.
We have bandage stop shelf in the kitchen.
Thanks, mrs.
I'll go.
See?
Now this is what a marriage is all about -- compromise.
Is your finger okay?
Yeah, yeah, it's just a small cut.
You know, mrs.
Solis, Um, I really like it when we hook up, but, um, well, you know, I-I got to get my work done, and I can't afford to lose this job.
This table is hand-carved.
Danielle, there is nothing abnormal about basil puree.
Just once, couldn't we have a soup that people have heard of?
Like french onion or navy bean.
First of all, your father can't eat onions.
how's the osso buco?
It's okay?
Andrew, I spent three hours cooking this meal.
How do you think it makes me feel when you say "it's okay" in that sullen tone?
Tim Harper's mom gets home from work, pops open a can of pork and beans, and boom, they're eating.
Everyone's happy.
You'd rather I serve pork and beans?
Apologize now.
I am begging.
I'm saying, do you always have to serve cuisine?
Can't we ever just have food?
Are you doing drugs?
Change in behavior is one of the warning signs, and you have been as fresh as paint for the last six months.
That certainly would explain why you're always locked in the bathroom.
- Trust me, that is not what he is doing.
Mom, I'm not the one with the problem here, all right?
You're the one always acting like she's running for mayor of Stepford.
Rex.
Seeing that you're the head of this household, I would really appreciate you saying something.
Three days after my funeral, Lynette replaced her grief with a much more useful emotion -- indignation.
Tom, this is my fifth message, and you still haven't called me back.
Well, you must be having a lot of fun on your business trip.
Well, guess what -- the kids and I want to have some fun, too, so unless you call me back by noon, we are getting on a plane and joining you.
Mom!
Not now, honey.
Mommy's threatening daddy.
Mom.
No, I -- where are your brothers?
- Noodles.
- My favorite.
Lynette Scavo?
Crap.
Lynette.
Years.
Uh, how are you?
We all say if you hadn't quit, you'd be running the place by now.
Yeah, well...
how's domestic life?
And there it was -- the question that Lynette always dreaded.
for those who asked it, only one answer was acceptable, so Lynette responded as she always did.
You know what I don't get?
Why you married mr.
he promised to give me everything I've ever wanted.
And did he?
Well, then, why are we here?
Because I don't want to wake up one morning with a sudden urge to blow my brains out.
Hey, can I have a drag?
Absolutely not.
How would you feel about me using your child-support payments for plastic surgery?
Stop being so nervous.
You're just asking him out to dinner.
It's no big deal.
You know, when I was in fifth grade, I made the white house out of sugar cubes.
Stop stalling and go before mike figures out he can do better.
You were using me to hurt dad.
Oh, that's right.
Well, I -- I just, uh, was wondering if, um...
if there was any chance that you, uh...
I-I just wanted to ask if...
- Hey there, Susan.
What are you -- I was making ambrosia, and I made too much, so I thought I'd bring some over to mike.
Uh, Susan was just going to ask me something.
I have a clog.
The clog's in the pipe.
Yeah, that's usually where they are.
Well, I've got one.
Well, uh let me get my tools.
Yeah, just give me two minutes.
Just stuff the hair down there.
I stuffed it.
It's not enough to clog it.
Okay, look.
Put in this peanut butter and this cooking oil.
- Mom - And these olives.
Mom, I'm telling you, it's not working.
How am I going to stop up the sink?
Looks like somebody stuffed a bunch of popsicle sticks down here.
I've told julie a million times not to play in the kitchen.
Kids, you know?
All right, I'll go put in your orders, and I'll be right back with your drinks and your plates for the salad bar.
Andrew, Danielle, napkins?
Could we go play until our food gets here?
Andrew, this is family time.
- I think that we should all - Go ahead and play.
I know that you think I'm angry about coming here, but I'm not.
You and the kids wanted a change of pace, something fun.
Probably we'll want something healthier tomorrow night, though.
I'm thinking about chicken Saltimbocca.
I want a divorce.
I just can't live in this -- this detergent commercial anymore.
- The salad bar's right over there.
Bree Van De Kamp.
Bree longed to share the truth about her husband's painful betrayal, but sadly for Bree, admitting defeat was not an option.
Okay, well, I got you the honey mustard dressing.
The ranch looked just a little bit suspect.
Are we going to talk about what I said?
If you think I'm going to discuss the dissolution of my marriage in a place where the restrooms are labeled "chicks" and "dudes," you're out of your mind.
What's in this?
What do you mean, what's in this?
- With -- with onions?
You put onions in my salad.
No, I didn't.
The sound that awakened my son was something he'd heard only once before, many years ago when he was quite young, but he recognized it instantly.
Seven days after my funeral, life on Wisteria lane finally returned to normal, which, for some of my friends...
was unfortunate.
Now what?
Daddy's home!
I have to go back to frisco in the morning, but I got your call.
You sounded a little frazzled.
It's been a little rough.
Daddy, did you bring us any presents?
Oh, god, presents.
Wait a minute let me see.
But I'm not going to give it to you unless you promise me to go outside right now and practice throwing it for 20 minutes, okay?
You promise?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Get out of here.
Go out!
Deeper!
Oh, you got to be kidding.
That's all right, baby.
Well, is it okay if I just lie here?
And I love you more.
Oh, wait, I got to tell you, I was having trouble with swelling, so the doctor took me off the pill, so you're just going to have to put on a condom.
Condom?
I can't believe you tried to kill me.
Yes, well, I feel badly about that.
I told you, mrs.
Huber came over, and I got distracted.
Since when do you make mistakes?
I-I'm sick of the bizarre way your hair doesn't move.
I'm sick of you making our bed in the morning before I've even used the bathroom.
You're this plastic suburban housewife with her pearls and her spatula who says things like "we owe the hendersons a dinner."
who used to burn the toast and drink milk out of the carton...
and laugh?
but he husband never knew, because when Bree finally emerged...
she was perfect.
I found my earrings.
Was John here today?
It dark.
You just can't see that the lawn has been mowed.
It hasn't been.
I'm not feeling the grass.
We're late.
Time for me to go into my dance.
Oh, excuse me.
Ma'am?
You see that man who just walked away?
Oh, mrs.
Huber,how you doing?
Oh, it's upset?
It's been running through me ever since.
Edie Bri's son is spending the night tonight.
Apparently, Edie is having a gentleman friend over for dinner, He just can't.
And despite the precariousness of her situation, Susan took a moment to mourn her loss.
It didn't take Susan long to realize this was just not her night.
Is somebody out there?
Oh, my god!
Candles unattended in the den.
Paramedics said she was lucky.
She could have been killed.
She ran out with nothing on.
She was having sex with some guy when the fire started.
What happened to him?
I-I just, uh...
feel really bad for Edie.
Wow, what happened?
Mike.
And suddenly, there he was, like a phoenix rising from the ashes.
I-I thought you were --
Uh, where were you?
Hey, it's me.
- Do you have anything yet?
No, nothing yet, but don't worry.
The next day, my friends came together to pack away my clothes, my personal belongings, and what was left of my life.
To Mary Alice -- a good friend and neighbor.
To Mary Alice.
You guys check out Mary Alice's clothes?
Size 8?
Ha.
She always told me she was a size 6.
Guess we found the skeleton in her closet.
Not quite, Gabrielle.
It's a letter addressed to Mary Alice.
How ironic -- to have something I tried so desperately to keep secret treated so casually.
It's open.
I know what you did.
It makes me sick.
I'm going to tell.
What does this mean ?
I don't know but check out the post mark.
Oh my god!
Do you think this is why she...
Mary Alice, what did you do ?
Nothing is what it appears to be.
It seems pretty clear to me.
Because you're only seeing part of it.
I'm talking about a clean slate.
You ever try and clean an actual slate?
You always see what was on it before.
Are you volunteering...
I don't have a choice, do I?
How did it get this far?
Caroline, actions have consequences.
Oh, God, you're loving this, aren't you?
I'm sorry you don't understand what I'm offering here.
But what we do helps people.
If you become a part of that, it can help you.
You're just looking out for me.
Perhaps better than you have.
We can take care of this mess.
After your five-year term, you will be free to...
I don't deserve this.
I was just trying to make a difference, trying to...
take my place in the world, you know, like she always said, and now I'm...
Actions have consequences.
What if they didn't?
Happy birthday, man.
No way.
You cheated.
How did l cheat?
You did something that will prove to have been cheating.
This isn't over.
Oh, my God, you are a sore loser.
Oh, I wouldn't know...
I've never lost.
That's okay, the first time, you're always just a little bit sore.
Oh, wow, that's funny, coming from a cheater who is also a little bitch.
You sure you didn't let me win?
Two out of three.
Nah.
Let's just dance.
You having a good time?
The best.
Listen, uh, I know at the beginning of the weekend, we said no strings.
We also said no ropes, and look how long that lasted.
Yeah, I remember.
I remember it all.
I always will.
What, like I'd forget?
You think this is a normal weekend for me?
Maybe?
I had no idea you were a moron.
Look, it's...
it's little, it's stupid, but...
I want you to have it.
You're an amazing guy, Matt.
When you say it, I almost believe.
For everything.
It's getting late.
You're not getting out of another dance.
Of course not.
I'm just gonna go grab a drink.
You ready for your treatment?
I think it's time.
Did you have a nice time?
I met a guy.
Dude, where's your friend?
It's time for her to go.
Had to get to her carriage before it turned into a pumpkin.
Stroke of midnight.
Midnight?
The end of the ball.
Dude, it...
it's like 5:00.
Hey, you think you could take me back to the party after my treatment?
I'll wait right here.
You're good people.
Maybe I shouldn't go back.
The last thing I want to be is clingy, but you know when you just...
you meet someone and...
you know?
If I'm wrong, I'll know.
I mean, Matt can't lie to save his life.
If he gives me that look, I'll walk away.
But I don't know, I think...
he feels it, too.
I think I found something real.
I'm glad.
This is gonna pinch a bit.
You have a nice time?
You ready to be a sad second place, man?
No obligations.
No pressure.
It's just an experiment.
How much fun can we have in three days?
Hello, Echo.
How are you feeling?
Did I fall asleep?
For a little while.
Shall I go now?
If you like.
Everything go all right with the wipe?
Why don't you just ask Echo?
Because she can't remember.
Of course, it went all right.
Imprint's gone.
The new moon has made her a virgin again.
Is there some reason it shouldn't have?
Something happen during the engagement?
I think she finally met the right guy.
You're so jaded, and at such a middle age.
She had fun, right?
She thought so.
There's nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so, man friend.
We gave two people a perfect weekend together.
We're great humanitarians.
Who would spend their lives in jail if anyone ever found this place.
We're also misunderstood...
which great humanitarians often are.
Look at Echo.
Not a care in the world.
She's living the dream.
Whose dream?
I don't understand.
You don't have to understand.
You just have to do as I tell you.
They'll find out, you know.
And why should I care about that?
They'll laugh at me.
Everybody watches it.
It's all they talk about.
That's 'cause their brains are melting, and that reality crap is the reason why.
I finished my homework.
Well, if you finished your homework, you should get a present.
How about...
Knowledge.
You have that right.
Why are we stopping?
You know I could watch it, and you'd never know.
Yeah, well, I'd see it all over your face even when you were sleeping.
Some kind of roadblock.
And I'll know.
Tyrant.
She's completely helpless.
I mean, she's 12 years old, just a kid.
How much are they demanding?
Five million.
And you'll pay it.
In Mexico, kidnapping is a thriving business, which is part of why we live here when my factories are there.
But if you pay, there's a better chance...
Have you contacted the police?
I was instructed not to.
They're useless, anyway.
I need this to go smoothly.
I need Davina to be okay.
Crestejo, you're a valued client.
We will of course provide what you need.
But there is a risk factor involved.
I don't want Rambo.
I want a negotiator.
This goes like clockwork, you understand?
That's who I need.
Clockwork.
Well, our Actives are not robots, but I think we can make this work for you.
Dominic will discuss the security details with you, and you can enter the rest into the confessional.
Please remember, the Active won't know they came from here.
Any discussion of this place will only confuse them, and possibly send them right back.
I know how important it is that not happen.
I'm terribly sorry for all this.
We will help.
Yeah, this feels very tight.
I think you fell on it with something heavy.
Well, it's gonna be fine.
And your blood work and internals are all shipshape.
I'll just ask one of the staff to work on that knee.
Would you like a massage?
They're relaxing.
I'll set that up.
I don't remember what fell on me.
Does that bother you?
We'll look after you.
Does someone look after you?
Why don't you wait in the massage area, and I'll call for someone to work on that knee.
She's not asleep.
What...?
Just keep mapping the tissue.
Hey, Echo.
She hurts.
She does.
That's because it's her first time, and, uh, we have to do more extensive work on her.
Work?
We're making her better.
In a little while, she'll be strong and happy, and she'll forget all about this and you...
will have a new friend living with you.
Her name is Sierra.
Sierra.
Aren't you supposed to be getting your physical with Dr.
Saunders far from here right now?
We're ready for your massage, Echo.
Something fell on me.
I bet it was something great.
Agent Ballard, you were assigned to case designate Dollhouse over 14 months ago.
How would you describe your progress to date?
Slow.
I'm actually very impressed by what I see here.
You've physically threatened a senator, disrupted a seven-year human trafficking investigation, been arrested for trespassing on Prince Amoudi's yacht.
The only legal action you've successfully followed through on is your divorce.
Paul, let me ask you.
After all this, do you think the Dollhouse really exists?
I know it does.
You've seen it then?
You could, like, take us on a tour?
Look, we all know this assignment is a joke.
If it's a joke, then pull me off it.
Except you can't, because someone bigger than you thinks it isn't a joke.
I'm a billionaire.
I can hire anybody for anything.
And I'm gonna go to an illegal organization and have them build me, program me, what, the perfect date?
Confessor, assassin, dominatrix, omelet chef?
I'm paying a million dollars for that?
I can get that.
I have everything I want.
Nobody has everything they want.
It's a survival pattern.
You get what you want, you want something else.
If you have everything, you want something else.
Something more extreme, something more specific.
Something perfect.
Put it like that, it doesn't sound so bad.
The only way to imprint a human being with a new personality...
Which we've yet to prove possible... is to remove their own.
Completely.
We're talking about people walking around who may as well have been murdered.
Which to me sounds pretty bad.
Is that why you interfered with the Russians?
The Borodin case?
They're the top of the heap in human trafficking.
If people are disappearing...
That is an ongoing investigation!
We have a chance to dry up a major pipeline of girls being smuggled into this country, and you do not jeopardize that for a fairy tale!
You will stay out of everyone's way, and you will stop pissing off powerful public figures without any evidence!
You've been out of line, Paul.
You have to back off.
You need to keep away from the Borodin case.
Are you able to back off?
That won't be a problem...
sir.
Would you sit down, please?
The situation is a kidnap and ransom, 12 year-old girl named Davina Crestejo.
The girl's supposed to be exchanged for $5 million, which her father is willing to pay.
And we are going to help him do that.
Kidnapper's Latino, probably Mexican, refers to himself as "Mr.
Sunshine."
This is a high risk engagement so you'll have both eyes and ears this time.
Audio off a wire, and we'll tap you into his security vid on the house and grounds.
Anything goes wrong, or feels wrong, you extract Echo immediately.
Her purpose is to facilitate the exchange, nothing more.
No one is to be brought to justice.
We'll skip any ex-cop heroics, if you don't mind.
Not a problem.
My only priority...
Is Echo.
So, who does she think she is?
Gabriel Crestejo?
I'm sorry, who are you?
You asked for me.
I'm here to help.
Our mutual friend referred me.
I'm sure he did.
I'm a little surprised, though, that he sent you.
I'm good with people.
I put them at their ease.
In my experience, a beautiful woman never puts anyone at their ease.
Fatherly types do that.
They're warm and comforting, make people feel safe.
A beautiful woman distracts people, makes them nervous, or jealous.
I can't afford that.
Not with what's at stake here.
I think our friend sent the wrong person.
Fatherly types.
Like Edward James Almos.
I hope there's no offense.
None taken, and I'm not leaving.
You can hire someone else, give them my fee, but I'm the one best qualified to save your daughter.
I've been doing this my whole life.
Just this.
You want people to feel comforted?
We're past that.
These men are stone professionals.
They took her from your house.
Not on the way home from school, or in the park...
they came inside your house, your seriously fortified house, in order to tell you that they could.
I've dealt with the others...
amateurs, men with a grudge, or an urge.
You want a professional, a man who knows the business.
Knows how high the stakes should or shouldn't go.
The percentage of successful negotiations goes way up.
And what's the percentage?
Not a hundred.
Is her room in here?
I'll show you.
We haven't touched anything.
Glasses, Topher?
She's nearsighted.
Is that supposed to make people take her seriously?
Like the librarian thing is gonna hide the fact that she's...
Am I speaking Urdu?
She's nearsighted, Boyd.
You can mess up her eyesight?
I can mess up the neural connections to her eyesight.
Make her brain process the information it gets any way I want.
As, for example, blurry.
But why would you?
Why handicap her in a job like this?
You see someone running incredibly fast, the first thing you gotta ask is, are they running to something, or are they running from something?
And the answer is always both.
So these personality imprints...
they come from scans of real people.
Now, I can create amalgams of those personalities, pieces from here or there, but it's not a greatest hits; it's a whole person.
Achievement is balanced by fault, by...
a lack.
Can't have one without the other.
Everyone who excels is overcompensating.
Running from something.
Hiding from something.
The past?
Sometimes.
So what's in the past that you gave Echo?
That's her business, Boyd.
She's right for the job.
She's spent her life profiling and negotiating with kidnappers.
That's the person they needed, so that's who Echo is.
The expert.
Who's nearsighted.
She also has asthma.
What took you so long?
Is this Mr.
Sunshine?
Where is Gabriel?
He's right here.
My name is Eleanor Penn.
And I'll be handling the transaction.
I told him no cops!
Put Gabriel on, I'm gonna cut his little girl so he can hear.
He can hear.
I am not a cop.
I'm not FBI.
And I have no interest in justice.
I'm here only to facilitate a private transaction and make sure no one is hurt during it.
No, you're a federale...
you think I'm stupid?
I think you knew Gabriel wouldn't call the authorities if you took Davina.
Which was not stupid.
But Gabriel can't do this alone.
He's afraid, and angry, and he knows those emotions are of no use right now.
So you'll deal with me.
And everybody will get what they want.
You may call me Miss Penn.
I may?
I call you Miss?
I think I call you Ellie, since we're becoming such good friends.
I will not answer to Ellie.
Oh, so you're the schoolteacher now, huh?
What, you gonna rap my knuckles if I'm bad?
It's unlikely.
You telling me how it's gonna be?!
I have the girl, okay?
I make all the rules.
You want $5 million?
Let's make it eight.
8 million.
That's two million apiece.
Call back in 40 minutes and let Davina talk to her father.
There's no way you're just gonna give me an extra three mil...
You have the money.
It would have been polite to ask.
They have to get used to doing it my way.
Right now, they're getting very used to it.
Or they think she's messing with them.
But you'll give them the money.
You have to get used to doing things my way, too.
The last time a family's head of security let their daughter get kidnapped, she was recovered in three days.
His body never was.
Speak out of turn again and I will scold you.
How'd you know there was four of them?
You said, "2 million apiece."
Guy didn't blink.
You heard him not blink?
Four's the median number in these cases.
Three guys with ambition, one with information.
What more can you tell me about them?
I'll tell you when it's useful for you to know it.
They better put her on.
They will.
In 38 minutes.
You're the boss, Ellie.
Miss Penn.
What, you don't believe me?
This immigration guy, he's patting me down, he's feeling me up, he's starting to get very personal, right?
I tell him he should buy me a drink, tell me I'm pretty, he wants to grope me like that.
Oh, you're a talker, new guy.
It's Lubov.
Uh, Velnik asked me to come, give Mr.
Borodin my respects.
I like a talker.
Immigration, he doesn't even crack a smile.
Then out comes the rubber glove.
Loomis, I got a name for you.
You got $8 million for us?
If it's that easy, I think we gonna make it an even ten.
What-What are you doing?
You hang up on me again, I chop her up right now!
And I'll use her for bait!
Is Davina ready to talk to her father?
You got one minute.
Papi?
I'm scared.
Mija...
Mija, I'm right here.
Papi, I'm sorry.
No, no, no, mija, it's not like that.
You just do as the men say, I'm gonna bring you home.
It's okay, it's gonna be okay.
All they want is money.
They yell at me.
Except the one with the mask, he doesn't talk.
It's dark in the room, but I can hear the...
Davina, I'm a friend of your father's.
I need to know if they're hutting you.
Not much.
Did they feed you?
But they push me around.
A little.
And they wouldn't let me use the bathroom at first, but then they did.
It's the small kind...
Your father wants to tell you something.
I, uh...
I, uh, I want you to be strong, Davina.
Remember that I love you and I will never let anything happen to you.
I love you, Papi.
Please put the man back on.
The money tomorrow.
I call you at noon to tell you where.
And she'll be there.
There are only two ways for this to go...
either everybody gets what they want, or nobody does.
We will not pay if she's not there.
You told me you're good with people.
I misspoke.
I'm good at people.
She was trying to tell me something!
And I needed her not to.
Suppose they figured out what she was telling you before you did?
Do you think this would endear her to them?
But if we could find her before they do something...
And what, rush in with tear gas?
These people don't handle surprises well.
They get their money or they dig a hole.
You have to trust that I have done this many, many times.
I have to trust that...
right.
Yesterday, you weren't a nurse or a clown in the circus.
You're the best, the best one they could send.
Why is that?
What makes you so good at this?
I don't have any hobbies.
You have to do better than that.
You have to make me believe, believe like you believe.
You want my résumé?
I studied psychology, forensic science, profiling from former instructors at Quantico.
Been licensed seven years.
Handled over 12 negotiations.
Why, why, why?
What made you do all those amazing things?
Did something terrible happen in your childhood?
Did horrible men come and snatch you away?
You were kidnapped.
When I was nine.
How long did that...
Three months.
And they did things to you.
Unprofessional things.
Is this helping you in some way?
You don't remember?
Maybe it's all made up.
There was one.
He got rid of the others after they were paid and...
All the terrible memories these men put in your head.
Why would they do that?
Sometimes the bad things just happen and no one can protect you from them.
I'm okay.
I'm fine, I'm okay.
I'd like to get some sleep.
We've got a long day tomorrow.
I'll have Maria make you up a bed.
Don't move.
Hey, make sure the ladies at my table have what they need, huh?
The champagne never stops flowing.
The good stuff.
For the first few bottles, the good stuff.
After that, the house is fine.
You're about to make a very bad mistake.
Dollhouse.
Say it.
Say it again.
Your brains are...
Okay, dollhouse.
Doll freaking house.
I'll keep saying it...
it's fun to say.
Dollhouse, dollhouse, dollhouse, dollhouse.
You see the Borodins, you say it some more.
You think you want to mess with the Borodins?
No, but they supply girls, some of them very high-end, to fine, upstanding clients.
There's one client I'm interested in.
Find out who's connected to the Dollhouse, the Borodins won't be touched, and you'll never see me again.
I haven't seen you yet.
You will.
Wash your hands.
And your shoes.
You look better than on the phone, chica.
It's still Miss Penn.
Me disculpo.
The money.
This is not your first time.
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Davina!
Davina, mi hija, it's okay.
Papi's here.
Okay...
now you show.
We take that on the boat.
Your daughter steps off.
You don't move towards her until we are away.
Whoa...
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.
Hey, Boyd, what's going on?
We're good so far.
No, no, Echo's not good.
Something's not good, and Echo knows it.
This is maybe your first time.
It's just a condition...
we're not making trouble.
Are you trying to blow this?
Don't let them on the boat.
You said that's the way it is.
They're not gonna give her back.
He's not gonna give her back.
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
She gets off first.
Get the hell back.
You give me my daughter!
We need an ambulance.
The client is shot.
Extract the Active.
Do it now.
Is it bigger than your thumb?
Echo.
Is it...
is it bigger than your thumb?
Miss Penn, look at me.
You can't fight a ghost.
It's so dark.
Of course it's dark.
It's better.
You don't see, you don't make a sound.
You forget his face.
Whose face?
He's all thumbs.
What happened on the dock?
What went wrong?
He doesn't give them back.
Who, the man in the mask?
He's old now.
He's the same age.
I am proportionately similar to a girl, a small girl.
The older man.
You know him.
He's the one that took you.
They never found him.
He said he was a ghost.
You can't fight a ghost...
but he was heavy, the weight of him.
Ghosts aren't heavy.
Ghosts are sheets with holes cut out.
He took you away.
And now...
It's unprofessional.
He's taken Davina.
She's proportionately similar to a girl.
He won't touch her until he's taken care of the others.
The other two men?
They'll be dividing the money and make sure there's no tracers, no dye pack.
They'll get excited.
They won't see him coming.
Six hours.
Before he kills them?
And takes her away.
On the boat?
It's been seen.
They were planning to beach it anyway.
It's a Houlberd, 30-footer.
It's got a decent range.
And it was riding high.
They haven't bothered to fuel it...
good.
Let's place them anywhere from here...
to here.
Still a lot of choices.
I'm missing something.
The man an the phone...
what did he say?
The mask.
Only one man wore a mask.
Because she knows him.
He doesn't just have information.
He's in her life.
We find him, we find the ghost.
How does she know him?
Something the other one said.
We need to do my treatment now, and we need to do it fast.
Miss Penn...
Come on, Langton.
A client's in critical, weapon's discharged.
You think I'm gonna let you hold her hand while Topher scrubs her?
Two minutes.
You have any idea of the crap that's raining down on us?
Handler intervention triggers an immediate debriefing - to make sure that we weren't exposed.
- We're close.
As soon as I finish my treatment, we'll find her.
He won't do this again.
I need to talk to DeWitt.
You need to tell me everything that went down today.
It wasn't a glitch.
The imprint was rock solid.
There was a weird spike last night, but what happened at the dock happened to Eleanor Penn.
Or the people we made her out of.
I need you to do this quickly.
I live to serve.
Barging in here isn't going to help your situation, Mr.
Langton.
Echo can find the Crestejo girl.
He's faster than you'd think.
You cannot wipe her right now.
I can do any damn thing I see fit.
Echo botched the engagement.
She jeopardized this entire operation.
of an abused girl, and you put her face to face with her abuser.
She recognized one of her kidnappers.
And she can find him again.
She's the only one who can.
Ma'am, we need to distance ourselves from this.
We don't know if the client's going to live.
This is becoming news.
I'm sorry, Mr.
Langton, but this is complicated.
No, it isn't.
Echo's in pain, but she's the right girl for the job, and she knows the territory.
She can find Davina before that man lays a finger on her.
You wipe her, you've lost all of that.
We do not have a client!
We have a mission!
We prefer to call them engagements.
You have not been here as long as some of the others, so I will overlook the error.
I've been here long enough to know that you like to tell yourself what we do helps people.
Let Echo help this girl.
Where are my glasses?
I know how to find her.
It was the first call.
The kidnapper said, "You're the schoolteacher now."
He stressed you're, like there's already a teacher in the mix.
The one in the mask.
Check her school.
See who's missing.
He's been close to her.
He's probably not Latino.
Penn, I'm Lawrence Dominic.
Security contractor.
I have a chopper standing by.
I'll need a radio contact while we're en route.
That'll be Mr.
He's staying here.
She needs backup.
Not from you.
I'm her handler.
Miss DeWitt will decide what you are.
James Shepherd, Caucasian male, 33.
Out sick 12 consecutive days.
Has a sister with an isolated house six miles from the dock.
I'm going to need a clean and quiet touchdown with zero chance they'll see or heaeaour approach.
With respect, the last time you went head to head with these people, you folded.
My man's fully...
Your man gives me ten minutes, or Davina will die.
How is she?
See the blue areas?
That's fear.
It all looks blue.
That's where I'm going with this.
Uh, the persona we developed?
Bunch of different people.
And one of them was abused by the guy she ran into.
Yeah, I looked her up.
She killed herself.
Last year.
She never got away from him.
What are we playing at?
It's the woman.
From the drop?
Damn it!
Who else?
You see anyone else?
I'm alone.
Please open the door.
Don't do it, man.
Who knows where we are?
Everyone's going to know very soon, Mr.
Shepherd.
You left a wide trail, but that's not your problem.
He is.
Hell you on about?
Soon as that money's counted, he's going to kill both of you.
You think we fall for that crap?
Turn us on each other?
You tell us how long till they come, you talk.
Or I find something to stuff that mouth up.
I think I'm a little old for you.
The man that shot Mr.
Crestejo is dead.
You will be identified as the ringleader.
You two haven't killed anyone.
You can let me leave with Davina, and get out of the country very rich men.
The girl's not here.
She's in the fridge.
You unplugged it and pulled out the shelves.
You had to rope it shut, of course, 'cause these days, they don't lock.
We were gonna tell people where she was.
You were gonna die.
'Cause there's something this man wants even more than eight million dollars.
Shut your mouth!
Lady seems to know a lot.
I know everything.
All the girls he kept, till he was through with them.
Till he got bored, or just broke them down.
I even know about the one he dumped in the river before he was sure she was dead.
You can't hurt me anymore.
We're going now.
We'll be okay.
Go now.
I told you to wait.
There were shots.
We made a call.
We were coming out.
Is she injured?
Are you hurt?
Then get over it.
The money's here.
I want it bagged, and our presence swept in three minutes.
You're okay.
You're okay, okay?
You're free.
It's a solid win, ma'am.
The client's stabilized.
We have the payment, plus the eight million.
And both Actives performed admirably.
It nearly came crashing down on us.
It was contained.
Now tell me how we're going to contain this.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, get that thing out of my face.
It's for the video yearbook.
Say hi to your mom.
Hi, Mom!
Are we done?
Is there someone you'd like to say good-bye to?
Ditra and Meg, life without you will be meaningless and bleak, my dormies.
Oh, and the girls of Sigma Tau, sisters forever.
Let's hope those venereal diseases make you all sterile, you snobby-ass pack of hos.
Oh, that's definitely going in.
So, what are you planning on doing after graduation?
Yeah, I probably should have thought about that.
I'd like to take my place in the world, like Mrs.
Dundee taught us.
Global Recovery, Doctors Without Borders.
The world is in need of some serious saving.
And I want to travel.
Travel around the world as I save it.
In a private jet that I pilot and design.
Okay, go ahead and laugh, yearbook monkey.
I know: I'm such a cliche.
What can I say?
I want to do everything.
Is that too much to ask?
Make sure you change the water in that vase every day.
Chrysanthemums make the water turn.
And when I call to talk to Mr.
Kitteridge, make sure that you tell everyone to keep the receiver tight up to his ear.
Don't let them lay it on a pillow so I'm babbling like a fool into the air.
Don't worry, Mrs.
Kitteridge.
We'll take good care of him.
You have yourself a wonderful time with your son.
We'll see.
After three days, I stink like fish.
All right, Henry.
I'm off.
I'll give you a call when I get there.
But if the plane goes down, just know I'll be thinking of you when I hurdle to earth.
Are you going to New York for business or pleasure?
My son asked me to come down.
His new wife is three months pregnant and apparently has the pukes, so...
- I'm on a mission of mercy.
- How nice.
You're gonna be a grandmother.
This girl has two other children by two other fellas...
but it doesn't seem to bother my son, so I'm not gonna let it bother me.
- It's the way things are these days.
No point in being an old crank about it.
Going back to the view.
Over here!
For God's sake.
I can't leave the car.
I'll get a ticket.
- Hey, Mom.
- Where were you?
I thought you were meeting me at the gate.
- I was waiting for you there.
- Ma, I told you, nobody meets anyone at the gate.
They have security.
You could've reminded me.
I was standing there.
I didn't know where you were.
If you get a cell phone, you could've called me.
No, you need to be more clear with me.
Come on, get in, get in.
Let's go, let's go.
Slow it down.
Put this crap in the back.
I've been meaning to clean the car.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not the queen.
Move, move, I'm fine.
- Come on, sir.
- You got it.
So how is Dad?
His heart beats on.
His lungs are clear, his eyes are blue and he still likes this aftershave.
I've forgotten what his voice sounds like.
Well, it's still on the phone machine.
All you have to do is call.
Ann wants to meet him.
Any time you want to come up.
Traveling with Ann's kids isn't easy.
They're a handful.
The one-year-old keeps us up all night.
And the four-year-old?
Frankly, Mom...
Theodore is a little piece of crap.
Well, ducky, ducky soup.
I know you think your father's not all there, but he listens, Chris.
He's still engaged.
Sure, I know.
You're still doing that.
- The belching.
Does it annoy you?
And Ann won't care.
She's easy.
Not like Dr.
Sue then.
Nope.
You two still talk?
I can't really stand her, Ma.
Good to see you, kiddo.
Good God.
Christopher.
Is this it?
Careful getting out.
Hell.
- What's wrong?
- I stepped in dog mess.
Aw, Jesus.
People never pick up around here.
It's unbelievable.
This way, Ma.
Watch your step.
- Go ahead, Ma.
- I need to take off my shoe so I don't track dog mess in your house.
Just leave it right there.
Ann and the kids are out in the yard.
You can just go on back.
I'm just gonna put your suitcase in your room.
Get.
God.
Hey, you made it.
Hi, Olive.
It's so nice to finally meet you.
Do you mind if I call you Mom?
I've been dying to call you "Mom."
You can call me anything you like.
Do you need to attend to that child?
Yeah, she's just getting over a cold.
I'm coming, cranky girl.
Blow.
Hon, I scraped the grill.
- You wanna get it started?
- Who is she?
- That's Grandma Olive.
- Say hello.
- Did you bring me a toy?
It slipped my mind.
You were supposed to bring me one!
Grandma will be here the whole week.
She'll get you a toy later.
Mom, would you like a beer?
No, water will be just fine.
I had to take off my shoes.
I stepped in dog mess out there.
It's all over the block.
Hon, can I get you anything?
I'm good, babe.
I've got a run in my stocking already.
Here, Mom, why don't you sit?
- Good grief.
What was that?
- That's our tenant's parrot.
He has the floor above us.
A parrot.
Sounds just like my Aunt Ora.
He's a fundamental Christian.
- The parrot?
- No, the man.
He taught the parrot to say holy things every time you swear.
- Praise the Lord.
- Ass!
- Theo, cool it.
I'm just showing her how it works.
That'll be enough.
Thank you, young man.
Here you go, Mom.
Did you want ice?
No, that'll be just fine.
I just have one.
The hops in beer is supposed to be very healthy for women.
- Didn't know that.
Promotes estrogen.
You learn something every day.
So, Christopher, I didn't know you had a tenant.
Does he give you any trouble?
No, he keeps to himself.
Well, they can be a real nuisance.
When we were renting your house to all those summer people, they were always breaking things.
I'm sure.
Hey, Mom, did Chris ever have the chicken pox?
He says he can't remember.
No, he had the German measles, but not the pox.
It's good to know.
He did have a lot of colds though.
I would put that camphor rub on his chest.
It seemed to work.
I recommend that for your little one there.
Actually, I read that camphor rub can cause lung damage.
No, I never heard that.
That could be why Chris has asthma.
But you shouldn't feel badly.
No one knew back then.
Well, I don't feel badly because I don't believe it's true.
Hey, hon, how's the grill?
You can start getting the food ready.
Mom, I hope I didn't offend you.
There's just so much new information out there these days.
Yeah, sure.
We're so happy you're here.
- Theo.
- Yeah?
You wanna come help me with the food?
- Because.
I have to carry your sister.
She's only my half-sister.
Jesus, Theo, go help your mother now.
He listens to you.
I'm the bad cop.
You were always a well-behaved child.
You were never a brat.
You wouldn't allow it.
Aren't you glad?
Actually, I am.
My kid isn't gonna get away with any shit.
Ann knows how I feel.
She's in agreement.
This one seems very agreeable.
Could you not refer to my wife as "this one"?
I just said her name, Ann.
Noted.
Ann is good for me, Mom.
I know you're hurt that I didn't tell you about her sooner.
I take responsibility for that.
I don't even know how you two met.
- How did you meet?
- In a therapy group.
I know you think headshrinkers are the devil.
I could care less, Christopher.
Does she complain about her childhood as well?
She's getting over it.
Her mother is a raging alcoholic and her father was a marine who made her do push-ups every day.
That should make your childhood look like a breeze.
How's your depression?
- Still have it?
- I take Prozac.
- Does it help?
Have you ever thought about taking anything?
No, I don't believe in using drugs.
Kind of a strange attitude being that Dad was a pharmacist.
I don't believe in using drugs as a crutch.
Is that what you think I'm doing?
Probably not.
Pill-poppers don't run in our family.
We're a moderate bunch.
Christopher, are you concerned that Ann is drinking while carrying your child?
No, Mom.
Just saying.
Had to mention it.
I'm glad you did.
Excuse me, Ma.
I need to go get the meat.
- You need anything?
- Nope, nope, nope.
Happy as a lark.
- Hell.
- Glory to God.
You're the mother.
I'm Mrs.
And do you have a name?
I'm Mr.
O'Casey.
How do you do?
Glory to God.
I just met your tenant.
He's a bit strange.
Sean.
He's a weird guy.
- Says his name's O'Casey.
Any relation to Jim O'Casey?
Who?
Your old English teacher.
He used to drive us to school.
He and his wife had a shoeful of children.
- This fella one of those?
- Haven't a clue.
You might wanna ask.
I don't care to.
I never liked O'Casey.
He was a jerk.
Let me do something, Christopher...
set the table or something.
Go ask Ann.
- Can I help?
Great, Mom.
You wanna take Annabelle?
I'll make the salad.
Okay, sure.
Cool.
Yeah, it's okay.
Here we go.
In you go.
I know, I know.
I'm switching off because my beer got warm.
Only drank half of it.
Well, that can't help with your nausea.
My nausea?
I thought your pregnancy was giving you the pukes.
Healthy as a horse.
My son asked me to come down here to help you out.
I think he just wanted me to meet you.
so he could prove what a rotten mother I am.
Not at all.
Listen, Olive...
I understand everything you've been through, dealing with your father's suicide and all.
My mother is self-destructive as well.
She's still alive, but she's slowly killing herself with gin, so I'm already mourning her death.
And I've got all these anger issues, of course.
But anger doesn't serve.
You know?
It's not something I want to pass on to my kids.
But they're gonna blame you anyway.
Probably.
Hey, Mom, did you bring any photos?
- Photos?
- Family photos.
One of my projects is to put together a Kitteridge family book for the kids.
Be nice for them to have that, don't you think?
Well, maybe for Christopher's child, but I'm not sure it'll mean much to your other two.
Sure it will.
They love Chris.
He's their dad.
Where are the other fathers, if I may ask?
Theo's went back to Germany and Annabelle's dad is still in LA.
But they're both very comfortable with Christopher raising their kids.
Of course they are.
He's the one paying the bills.
I guess that's true.
Still, it's nice we all get along, don't you think?
- You want some apple, Mom?
- No, thank you.
Look, it's a snake.
Isn't that neat?
I'm coming to get you, Annabelle.
Honey, be gentle, okay?
It's a "gardener" snake.
- Where's your bathroom?
- It's just down the hall, Mom.
- No, I'm feeling a little queasy.
It must be from the traveling.
Do you want me to hold your head for you?
Dear God, no.
Grandma Olive, it's dinner time.
I'll be there in a minute.
- Are you throwing up?
- Are you pooping?
What are you doing then?
None of your business.
I need my privacy please.
They put me up in the basement.
Not a lot of natural light down here, but it's the cleanest spot in the place.
Not impressed with the neighborhood.
I stepped in dog mess.
I've been walking around in my stocking feet.
Like a dope I only packed one pair of hose.
Your new daughter-in-law is not the best housekeeper and she's not the best cook either, but friendly as a horse.
I think you two would get along.
A little dumb though.
She had a beer and said it was good for her estrogen.
Henry, who says things like that?
Chris seems happy though.
Still goes on about that shrink business, but don't worry.
They always go after the mother.
You'll come out smelling like a rose.
But I think he's missed me, Henry.
I'm still here.
I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna listen for a bit.
So, Mrs.
Kitteridge, you gonna run away with me?
You're gonna go home tonight and tell him?
Mom, you have to get up if you're taking Theodore to school.
- Mom?
- Yes, I'm up.
I made coffee if you want it.
- I don't want to wear my coat.
I want to wear my PJ's to school.
I can see you're having big feelings right now.
You don't love me.
Of course I love you.
I'm just getting very frustrated right now.
- Hello, Theodore.
- Hello, Sally.
And who's this?
Is this your grandmother?
I am the wicked witch from the north.
Enjoy your day, young man.
Goodbye, Grandma.
That one's bright, but needs direction.
Good to know.
Come on, girl.
You're a good old girl, aren't you?
I saw your tenant in the park today.
- Doesn't he work?
- No, he writes.
Hold still.
- What does he write?
Bad poetry, no doubt.
You are being so patient.
Do you know where he's from?
He's from Maine.
He is?
Come to think of it...
he told me that his father drove into a tree.
- He said that?
That's why he went born again.
Mom, it's a joke.
- He's from Great Neck.
- For God's sake, Christopher.
I don't get the joke.
Tell it again!
It's not a ha-ha joke.
- Who drove into a tree?
- Never mind.
- Did he get killed?
- It's just a story, sweetie.
- Why don't we all go out for ice cream?
- Yes, yes, yes!
Ice cream!
Mom, you don't have to do that.
Let's all go out.
Cream, ice cream, ice cream, ice cream!
- Ice cream, ice cream!
- Stop it.
Theo, calm down.
- Ice cream...
- Stop that.
- Ice cream, ice cream...
- Theo...
I said stop that!
Shit!
Mommy, Mommy!
- Jesus, Ma!
- It's okay, sweetie.
Well, I'm sorry, but he was tugging at me.
I could've toppled over.
Jesus Christ, Mom.
I don't even know what to say.
Chris.
Olive, I think what needs to happen is for you to apologize to Theodore and for Theodore to then forgive you.
I think that's the best thing to do right now.
That was a very...
That was not a nice thing to do to a little boy.
In my day, children got hit.
That's just the way people were raised.
That's true, Theodore.
Grandma's from another time and she doesn't know any better.
Just like Grandma Lehey doesn't know any better when she drinks.
You think you can forgive your grandma?
Go ahead, give her a hug.
Thank you, thank you.
You're a good little boy.
This isn't what I wanted.
It's what you ordered.
I didn't know I wouldn't like it.
What do you want, honey?
I want what she's having.
Well, maybe Grandma Olive will let you have some of hers.
Dear God.
Henry, it's happened.
I've turned into my old Aunt Ora who spills on herself.
And Chris saw.
They both saw me soil myself and they didn't bother to say a word about it.
They just let me sit there with slop down my front like I was nothing to them.
Henry, are you asleep?
Is anyone there?
Nurse.
My God.
Godfrey.
Hey, Mom.
It's time for me to go.
I didn't know you were out there, Mom.
What'd you say?
I said it's time for the damn old lady to go.
- What are you talking about?
- It's time.
- I stink like fish.
How'd you sleep?
She says she's leaving.
Everyone forgave you.
Theo is fine.
It was a good lesson.
I didn't come here for a lesson.
Okay, Mom.
No, not okay.
Don't talk to me like a child.
Mom, he's just trying to have a conversation with you.
No, he's not.
I'm being patronized.
And will you stop calling me "mom"?
You're not my spawn, for God's sake.
I was hoping that things had changed, but clearly they haven't.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I can't take responsibility for these bizarre mood changes of yours.
You behave like a paranoid.
- You always have.
- I don't need to sit here and be called a schizoid by my son.
- Olive, please stay calm.
Chris is only trying to tell you that sometimes your moods change kind of fast.
And that's been hard for him...
you know, growing up.
How would you know?
Were you there?
I suppose after all this shrink business, you two think you're experts now.
- Olive...
- No, it's okay.
Let her go.
- I'll call the car service.
- You're not going to drive me?
No, Mom, I've to be at work in an hour and Ann has to take the kids to school.
Do you remember the name of the service we use?
I can find it, hon.
So you're kicking me out just like that?
There's an example.
You say you want to leave and then you accuse me of being horrible to you.
Now, in the past, this would've made me feel awful, but I am not going to feel awful because this is not my doing.
I don't have to put up with it any more.
You have not had to put up with me for years.
You broke your father's heart when you moved away.
That's what started his downfall.
- I'm not even gonna touch that one.
- Mommy, can you come here?
Just a minute, hon.
- I'm fine.
For God's sake, why does she keep asking you if you're okay?
I am fine, okay?
I am perfectly fine having this discussion with you.
This is not a discussion.
You're on the attack.
I'm not attacking you.
As you can hear, I'm talking to you in a very calm voice.
Like a shrink.
I'm not a dope.
I know when I'm being handled.
I'm just trying to stay neutral, Mom.
You have a horrible temper and I'm not going to engage.
I'm not going to live in fear of you.
Fear of me?
What on earth have I done?
You always made me feel horrible and you made Daddy feel horrible.
Jesus, I don't know what I hated more...
when you went after me or when you sided with me and went after him.
Don't you talk to me about your father, High-and-Mighty.
You won't even talk to him on the goddamn phone.
He doesn't know who I am, Mom!
He's completely checked out.
And who could blame him, the way you treated him all these years.
You don't know what marriage is.
You and your divorce.
- Okay, Mom.
- You don't know what it is to live with someone till death do you part.
You don't know.
Things go on.
I know that, Mom.
Jim O'Casey.
You treated Daddy like shit because of him.
You don't think that I didn't see what was going on?
Nothing happened, if you want to know.
People hold back when they're married...
that's what you do.
Maybe you should've gone off and screwed the guy instead of screaming at Daddy and hitting me.
- I never hit you.
- You slapped me, Mom.
Many a time.
I have forgiven you...
but it would be nice if you would acknowledge it for fucking once.
I would never, never, never in a million years deliberately hurt a child.
Mom, we're done.
Okay, I have nothing left to say.
Well, you have it all figured out.
I hope you have a damn nice life.
Babe, I can't find Theo's permission slip for his field trip.
Have you seen it anywhere?
Yeah, I put it in his backpack.
I signed it already.
I'm sorry, Olive.
I'll call the car service.
I've got the number in my phone.
Why is she crying?
Take off your shoes and put them in a bin.
Take off your hat, your jacket, your belt.
Place your laptop in the bin.
Take off your shoes.
Ma'am, please, you need to take your shoes off.
For security, you need to take your shoes off.
No, I won't take off my shoes.
My stockings got shredded.
This is my only pair and they're a mess.
You can't go through without taking off your shoes.
And I told you I won't.
What's going on here?
Ma'am, step aside please.
What seems to be the problem here?
I won't take off my shoes, I won't.
- If you don't take off your shoes...
- I will not take off my shoes.
You don't get on that plane.
- I won't.
- Do you understand that?
Let's go, lady.
No liquids above 3oz beyond this point.
Take off your belt, your hat...
This one's nice.
There we go.
- Olive, you're here.
- I decided to come back early.
The place was full of dog hair and the new wife is a terrible cook.
You didn't get our message?
Is he all right?
Kitteridge passed away last night.
We called your house several times hoping you'd check in.
What time did he die?
It was about 10:30.
I called at 10:00.
Why didn't someone tell me he was dying?
No one knew, Mrs.
He passed away in his sleep.
- Would you like to sit down?
I should pack up his things.
You don't have to do that now, Mrs.
Really, someone can help you later.
Our grief counselor is here.
- Would you like to see her?
Did you change the water?
- The water?
- In his flowers.
I told you to change the water every day.
- You didn't, did you?
Kitteridge...
Was he asleep when I called?
- He might have been, yes.
- Why didn't someone wake him up?
So you people just left the phone off the hook and walked away.
You couldn't be bothered.
You let the old woman babble on to her dying husband as he drifts.
You didn't give a damn about my husband.
He was just one more stupid old man to wash and change and fill a bed.
Well, you can go to hell.
I will slit my throat before I wind up in a place like this.
- Olive, sweetheart...
- Dear God, Angela, leave me alone!
It's now 28 past the hour.
Here's something to brighten your day.
The Piano Concerto in E-flat Major by Jan Dussek.
Let's take a walk.
Oof.
Clancy.
Hup!
Are you dead?
Have you been stabbed or shot?
- Not that I know of.
- Is it your heart, do you think?
It could be.
- Can you move?
I haven't tried yet.
Try.
Move this one.
All right, try an arm.
I don't have one of those cell phones.
You?
But I didn't bring it.
Well, I'm gonna have to go back to my car and drive for help.
No, thank you.
Please don't leave me alone here.
Can you sit up?
- Well, let's try.
You gotta help.
I can't handle you on my own.
You're too big.
I'm up.
Well, your color's a little better.
How'd this happen, do you think?
I was walking.
Then I started feeling dizzy.
And then I sat down on this bench.
And the next thing, I'm lying on the ground and there's a woman squawking, "Are you dead?"
Well, you seem less dead every minute.
Get used to it.
I'm Olive Kitteridge.
I taught at the junior high school and my husband owned the pharmacy.
I think I've seen you and your wife around town.
Care to introduce yourself?
I'm Jack Kennison.
I'm sorry for being rude...
But who remembers names anymore?
I make the effort.
Seems the polite thing to do.
Who's this guy?
This is Clancy.
He's a good old boy, aren't you?
You should see a doctor.
I hate them myself, but you should get yourself checked out.
Well, I don't really care whether I croak or not.
Neither do I, but you don't wanna do it face down on a bicycle path.
Your wife wouldn't like that.
She doesn't care.
She died in December.
Then you're in hell.
I am in hell.
My Henry died six months ago.
He was in a nursing home for four years.
You'd think I'd be relieved.
You'd think.
My wife died of cancer.
It took much too long.
Give me a reason to wake up in the morning.
Don't have a clue.
I'm waiting for the dog to die so I can shoot myself.
What's your name again?
I'm not gonna tell you if you won't remember.
Come on, I'll take you to the doctor.
- No, thanks.
- Then I'll walk you to your car.
I'm capable of making it on my own.
Let's see you do it then.
Not going to see the Queen, you know.
Are you sure you're fine to drive home?
Well, I'm gonna follow you just to be sure.
Is that your car?
Let me see if this key works.
It's a little much for around here, don't you think?
It's an excellent car.
It starts.
Show-off.
Would you like to come in for lunch?
I could probably find an egg or a can of soup.
No, I have things to do.
Then go do them then.
I'm gonna call you later, see if your heart's still ticking.
You in the book?
Here's my card.
You know how to get home from here?
Lived here all my life.
Come on, Clance.
Little boy, don't do that!
You'll poke an eye out!
It's a witch!
She's a witch!
Blowhard.
"Beat these ingredients vigorously with a wire whisk..."
"...or a rotary beater for two or three minutes."
Are you still alive?
Hey, it's Olive.
Yes, I appear to be.
I could use a good meal.
Would you like to go out to dinner?
It will have to be early.
I go to bed with the birds.
I'll call around, find a place, call you back?
We're going Dutch, by the way.
Well, can I pick you up, at least?
Do you think we'll both fit in that ridiculous car of yours?
Shall I rent a van?
Will there be anything else, ma'am?
Old jerk.
All right then.
Right on time.
Yup.
This is a fine property.
How long have you had it?
Henry and I bought it about 40 years ago.
We had the property next door, but I sold it.
Must've made a nice profit there.
Can't complain.
I'd invite you in, but we don't want to be late.
So let's go then.
You can relax, Olive.
I'm a very good driver.
I have no doubt.
Feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society.
Was that Rush Limbaugh?
Good God, Olive.
What now?
You, Mr.
High-and-Mighty Harvard.
You listen to that idiot?
He has some interesting opinions.
He's a liar and a hatemonger.
He makes me want to puke.
Are we gonna do this or not?
Fine, I'll shut up.
You don't have to shut up, but try not to take personally who I am.
All we're doing is going to get some dinner.
Drive on.
And it's Yale.
I didn't go to Harvard.
I went to Yale.
I couldn't get into Harvard.
Was your wife a good cook?
A wonderful cook.
Took classes at Cordon Bleu.
Lots of butter.
In her will, she left me this.
I cook like a peasant.
That's how I kept my Henry trim.
Right now, I don't have a taste for...
much of anything.
Well, that's what happens.
How long did it take you to get your appetite back?
Never lost it.
Once they're gone, their flaws disappear, don't they?
There were times that I couldn't stand my Henry.
But now he seems like the perfect man.
I imagine our children will feel the same about us when we kick it.
That's not likely.
My son hasn't talked to me for six months.
Called once after his father died.
Upbraided me for sending a note.
A note about what?
That his father died.
You sent him a note?
Does he live overseas?
Brooklyn.
You couldn't call?
I had just gone down there for a visit.
We had a dreadful fight.
He didn't call to apologize to me, so I saw no reason to call him.
That's pretty harsh.
He never bothered to tell me that he had gotten married until two months after the fact, and I'm still waiting to find out whether or not I'm a grandmother.
Why should I call him with pertinent information?
That's childish, Olive.
Do you call your daughter?
- That's a different story.
What's she done to you?
I disagree with her lifestyle.
Does she live in a teepee?
I wish.
She lives with another woman the way others would live with a man.
Gay.
She's gay.
Yeah, that's what they like to call it.
- And that offends you?
- It doesn't make me happy.
Get over it.
It's time to get over it.
Be honest.
If your son were sharing a bed with a man, do you really believe you wouldn't mind?
Not in the least.
- No grandkids?
- I would still love him with all my heart.
You're just being sentimental.
You don't know how you would feel until you are presented with the actual situation.
And you are intolerant.
I suppose that you don't trust black people either.
You probably think they're shiftless.
not all of them.
Good grief.
I don't believe in coddling people who don't want to work.
Do you?
I don't have much sympathy for rich, old flub-dubs who can't put themselves in other people's shoes.
No, you can't throw that bleeding-heart crap at me.
You're just as intolerant as I am.
Judgmental.
Stubborn.
Petty.
And no, your son is not going to miss you when you're dead.
He'll be deeply relieved and you have to get ready for that.
Ducky, ducky, ducky soup.
Well, I am done here.
I'd like the check.
Well, I think I'd like some dessert.
I'm gonna pay my half of the bill and I'm gonna call myself a cab.
Put your goddamn money away.
No, I won't.
Well, I won't take it.
Leave me some dignity.
Well, we tried.
Make sure you can drive.
I'll order some coffee.
Don't kill yourself.
Clancy?
Clance.
Are you all right?
Calling to say that he got home safely, no doubt.
Stupid man.
I could care less.
This is Olive Kitteridge.
Not home.
Leave a message.
Hello, Olive.
It's Ann.
Chris doesn't know that I'm calling, but I wanted you to know that we had the baby.
His name is Kyle and he was born on March 28th.
Anyway, I thought you'd like to know.
Kitteridge, we're ready for you.
Are you having a picnic?
- Yup.
- Where's your food?
I ate it already.
- These are our woods, you know?
- Are they?
Well, I'll be on my way then.
You can stay lady, but don't litter.
Will do.
Are you here?
Hold on, Olive.
I'll be right there.
I was just laying down.
No, stay put.
I'll find you.
Are you feeling poorly?
Just soul-poor.
Body keeps banging on.
I brought you some of my tulips.
I don't normally give them away.
They're beautiful, Olive.
I'll go put them in some water.
No, come.
I'm a grandmother.
They left me a message on my machine.
I suppose I'll have to call them back now.
Yes, you should.
It'll be an easy call.
It's my fault my son can't stand me.
I haven't spoken with my daughter in two years.
Can you imagine that?
My husband loved me dearly and I was a horror to him.
My wife was a saint, and I had an affair.
I had an affair.
Almost...
I held back but I made my husband suffer for it.
And now you feel terrible.
God, I'm scared.
I hate scared people.
Well, that's too goddamn bad.
Do you hear anything?
Am I still alive?
Still banging on.
It baffles me, this world.
I don't want to leave it yet.
